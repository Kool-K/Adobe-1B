Any chemical process may\nbe broken down into a sequence of one or more single-step processes known either as elementary\nprocesses, elementary reactions, or elementary steps. Elementary reactions usually involve either\na single reactive collision between two molecules, which we refer to as a a bimolecular step, or\ndissociation/isomerisation of a single reactant molecule, which we refer to as a unimolecular step.\nVery rarely, under conditions of extremely high pressure, a termolecular step may occur, which\ninvolves simultaneous collision of three reactant molecules. An important point to recognise is that\nmany reactions that are written as a single reaction equation in actual fact consist of a series of\nelementary steps. This will become extremely important as we learn more about the theory of\nchemical reaction rates.\nAs a general rule, elementary processes involve a transition between two atomic or molecular\nstates separated by a potential barrier. The potential barrier constitutes the activation energy of\nthe process, and determines the rate at which it occurs. When the barrier is low, the thermal\nenergy of the reactants will generally be high enough to surmount the barrier and move over to\nproducts, and the reaction will be fast. However, when the barrier is high, only a few reactants will\nhave sufficient energy, and the reaction will be much slower. The presence of a potential barrier to\nreaction is also the source of the temperature dependence of reaction rates, which we will cover in\nmore detail in Section 19.\nThe huge variety of chemical species, types of reaction, and the accompanying potential energy\nsurfaces involved means that the timescale over which chemical reactions occur covers many\norders of magnitude, from very slow reactions, such as iron rusting, to extremely fast reactions,\nsuch as the electron transfer processes involved in many biological systems or the combustion\nreactions occurring in flames.\nA study into the kinetics of a chemical reaction is usually carried out with one or both of two main\ngoals in mind:\n1. Analysis of the sequence of elementary steps giving rise to the overall reaction. i.e.\nthe reaction mechanism.\n2. Determination of the absolute rate of the reaction and/or its individual elementary\nsteps.\nThe aim of this course is to show you how these two goals may be achieved.\n2. Rate of reaction\nWhen we talk about the rate of a chemical reaction, what we mean is the rate at which reactants\nare used up, or equivalently the rate at which products are formed. The rate therefore has units of\nconcentration per unit time, mol dm-3 s-1 (for gas phase reactions, alternative units of concentration\nare often used, usually units of pressure – Torr, mbar or Pa). To measure a reaction rate, we\nsimply need to monitor the concentration of one of the reactants or products as a function of time.\nThere is one slight complication to our definition of the reaction rate so far, which is to do with the\nstochiometry of the reaction. The stoichiometry simply refers to the number of moles of each\nreactant and product appearing in the reaction equation. For example, the reaction equation for\nthe well-known Haber process, used industrially to produce ammonia, is:\nN + 3H ¾ 2NH\n2 2 3\nN has a stochiometric coefficient of 1, H has a coefficient of 3, and NH has a coefficient of 2.\n2 2 3\nWe could determine the rate of this reaction in any one of three ways, by monitoring the changing\n3\nd[N ]\nconcentration of N , H , or NH . Say we monitor N , and obtain a rate of - 2 = x mol dm-3 s-1.\n2 2 3 2 dt\nSince for every mole of N that reacts, we lose three moles of H , if we had monitored H instead of\n2 2 2\nd[H ]\nN we would have obtained a rate - 2 = 3x mol dm-3 s-1. Similarly, monitoring the concentration\n2 dt\nof NH would yield a rate of 2x mol dm-3 s-1. Clearly, the same reaction cannot have three different\n3\nrates, so we appear to have a problem. The solution is actually very simple: the reaction rate is\ndefined as the rate of change of the concentration of a reactant or product divided by its\nstochiometric coefficient. For the above reaction, the rate (usually given the symbol ν) is therefore\nd[N ] 1 d[H ] 1 d[NH ]\nν = - 2 = - 2 = 3\ndt 3 dt 2 dt\nNote that a negative sign appears when we define the rate using the concentration of one of the\nreactants. This is because the rate of change of a reactant is negative (since it is being used up in\nthe reaction), but the reaction rate needs to be a positive quantity.\n3. Rate laws\nThe rate law is an expression relating the rate of a reaction to the concentrations of the chemical\nspecies present, which may include reactants, products, and catalysts. Many reactions follow a\nsimple rate law, which takes the form\nν = k [A]a[B]b[C]c... (3.1)\ni.e. the rate is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants each raised to some power. The\nconstant of proportionality, k, is called the rate constant. The power a particular concentration is\nraised to is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. Note that the orders do not have\nto be integers. The sum of the powers is called the overall order. Even reactions that involve\nmultiple elementary steps often obey rate laws of this kind, though in these cases the orders will\nnot necessarily reflect the stoichiometry of the reaction equation. For example,\nH + I → 2HI ν = k [H ][I ]. (3.2)\n2 2 2 2\n3ClO− → ClO − + 2Cl− ν = k [ClO−]2 (3.3)\n3\nOther reactions follow complex rate laws. These often have a much more complicated\ndependence on the chemical species present, and may also contain more than one rate constant.\nComplex rate laws always imply a multi-step reaction mechanism. An example of a reaction with a\ncomplex rate law is\n[H ][Br ]1/2\nH + Br → 2HBr ν = 2 2 (3.3)\n2 2 1 + k'[HBr]/[Br ]\n2\nIn the above example, the reaction has order 1 with respect to [H ], but it is impossible to define\n2\norders with respect to Br and HBr since there is no direct proportionality between their\n2\nconcentrations and the reaction rate. Consequently, it is also impossible to define an overall order\nfor this reaction.\nTo give you some idea of the complexity that may underlie an overall reaction equation, a\nslightly simplified version of the sequence of elementary steps involved in the above reaction is\nshown below. We will return to this reaction later when we look at chain reactions in Section 17.\nBr → Br + Br\n2\nBr + H → H + HBr\n2\nH + Br → Br + HBr\n2\nBr + Br → Br (3.4)\n2\n4\nAs well as having rate laws for overall reactions, we can of course also write down individual rate\nlaws for elementary steps. Elementary processes always follow simple rate laws, in which the\norder with respect to each reactant reflects the molecularity of the process (how many molecules\nare involved). For example,\nUnimolecular decomposition A → B ν = k [A]\nBimolecular reaction A + B → P ν = k [A][B]\nA + A → P ν = k [A][A] = k [A]2\nMulti-step processes may follow simple or complex rate laws, and as the above examples have\nhopefully illustrated, the rate law generally does not follow from the overall reaction equation. This\nmakes perfect sense, since the overall reaction equation for a multi-step process is simply the net\nresult of all of the elementary reactions in the mechanism. The ‘reaction’ given in the overall\nreaction equation never actually takes place! However, even though the rate law for a multi-step\nreaction cannot immediately be written down from the reaction equation as it can in the case of an\nelementary reaction, the rate law is a direct result of the sequence of elementary steps that\nconstitute the reaction mechanism. As such, it provides our best tool for determining an unknown\nmechanism. As we will find out later in the course, once we know the sequence of elementary\nsteps that constitute the reaction mechanism, we can quite quickly deduce the rate law.\nConversely, if we do not know the reaction mechanism, we can carry out experiments to determine\nthe orders with respect to each reactant (see Sections 7 and 8) and then try out various ‘trial’\nreaction mechanisms to see which one fits best with the experimental data. At this point it should\nbe emphasised again that for multi-step reactions, the rate law, rate constant, and order are\ndetermined by experiment, and the orders are not generally the same as the stoichiometric\ncoefficients in the reaction equation.\nA final important point about rate laws is that overall rate laws for a reaction may contain reactant,\nproduct and catalyst concentrations, but must not contain concentrations of reactive intermediates\n(these will of course appear in rate laws for individual elementary steps).\n4. The units of the rate constant\nA point which often seems to cause endless confusion is the fact that the units of the rate constant\ndepend on the form of the rate law in which it appears i.e. a rate constant appearing in a first order\nrate law will have different units from a rate constant appearing in a second order or third order rate\nlaw. This follows immediately from the fact that the reaction rate always has the same units of\nconcentration per unit time, which must match the overall units of a rate law in which\nconcentrations raised to varying powers may appear. The good news is that it is very\nstraightforward to determine the units of a rate constant in any given rate law. Below are a few\nexamples.\n(i) Consider the rate law ν = k[H ][I ]. If we substitute units into the equation, we obtain\n2 2\n(mol dm-3 s-1) = [k] (mol dm-3) (mol dm-3)\nwhere the notation [k] means ‘the units of k’. We can rearrange this expression to\nfind the units of the rate constant, k.\n(mol dm-3 s-1)\n[k] = = mol-1 dm3 s-1\n(mol dm-3) (mol dm-3)\n(ii) We can apply the same treatment to a first order rate law, for example\nν = k [CH N CH ].\n3 2 3",

Therefore, most people think\nReprint 2025-26\nthat diamond is forever.

Also there are reactions like inversion\nof cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate\nspeed. Can you think of more examples from each category?\nYou must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in\nterms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain\nperiod of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a\nreaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant\nor product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in\nterms of:\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the\nreactants,or\n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.\nConsider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the\nsystem remains constant.\nR fi P\nOne mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P.

            "refined_text": "xviii An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFinally, Chapter 15 addresses non-pseudo-steady state processes that are\nencountered in different areas. We place particular emphasis on these modes for\ncombustion and explosion reactions and heterogeneous reactions.\nThis book is the result of extensive experience teaching this course at this level\nand fundamental and applied research for over 30 years in chemical kinetics at the\nhighest level. These accumulated experiences have led me to a certain number of\nsignificant modifications compared to previously published books that cover this\nlevel of study.\nFirst of all, the arrival and growth of computer science that has populated\nlaboratories should be taken into account, which implies not only unprecedented\nopportunities of computation but, more significantly, changes in attitude towards the\nways of tackling problems and therefore how to teach kinetics. Thus, the sacrosanct\nchapter on formal kinetics has disappeared. Indeed, there is now only the resolution\nof three or four integrals that are rarely used nowadays because, unlike our\npredecessors, we possess derivative curves that give the speed, as easily as integral\ncurves; and because modeling always leads to speed expressions (from infinitesimal\ncalculus), the calculation of these few particular integrals is no longer of interest in\nkinetics.\nThe book no longer only refers to the famous “quasi-steady state approximation”\n(QSSA) for several reasons:\n– First, this QSSA is about the concentrations of intermediate species, which is\nonly applied to homogeneous systems with constant volumes, which is relatively\nrare and inadequate for many gas-phase reactions carried out at constant pressure, as\nis mostly the case. This is the same for reactions where a condensed phase is\ncreated.\n– Second, this QSSA is always presented as a calculus approximation that is only\njustified by computations on a small number of specific cases for which it is not\neven necessary. In fact, the introduction of the concept of a kinetic mode enables us\nto bond the approximation level of modeling to that of the accuracy and the\nreproducibility of measurements. Thus, we consider several types of kinetic modes\ncorresponding to multiple types of approximation in the calculation of speeds using\nvarious mechanisms.\nAmong these modes, those called pseudo-steady states are very important\nbecause they greatly simplify the calculations. These modes are characterized by the\nstability of the amounts of the intermediate species and are detected by the\nexperiment (described in Chapter 7). Other regimes termed “with rate-determining\nsteps” are also used, which is still in line with the precision of the measurements.\nPreface xix\nEven if the notion of reaction order was retained for the elementary steps, for\nwhich this notion is closely related with the mechanism, it is no longer used for\nmore complex reactions because the order obtained will not help us to infer the\nreaction mechanism. On the contrary, the notion of separate variables of speed –\nconcentration, temperature, etc. – is more directly related to the mechanisms and it\nshould be noted that the order with respect to a concentration is only a special case\nof the separation of this variable in the expression of speed.\nRegarding the influence of temperature, a clear distinction is made between the\nelementary steps, for which Arrhenius’ law is always true and leads to an activation\nenergy, and the common reactions (in general non-elementary) for which Arrhenius’\nlaw’s experimental application leads to a “temperature coefficient”. This coefficient\ncan sometimes, but by no means always, be linked to magnitudes related to the\nmechanism’s steps, such as activation energies and/or enthalpies. This temperature\ncoefficient is then called the apparent activation energy.\nWe retain this distinction between elementary steps to which we attribute a\nreactivity that follows an order and obeys Arrhenius’ law and the multi-step\nreactions for which the notion of specific speed is retained (volumetric or areal) and\nwhose expression of speed is far from obvious.\nThe importance given to the relationships between experiment and modeling\nshould also been noted. Very simple methods that enable us to verify, or discount, a\ncertain number of hypotheses are introduced: pseudo-steady state mode; and the\nseparation of variables.\nThis work has included information from many French and foreign books that\ncover this subject, some of which are cited at the end of the book, retaining their\ncontributions and originality.\nMy gratitude goes to all my students who attended my classes on kinetics\nbecause their feedback, questions and curiosity compelled me to ask myself real\nquestions and to deepen my reflections. I would also like to thank a number of\ncolleagues – foremost among whom is Françoise Rouquerol – for the discussions,\nsometimes fierce but always passionate and meaningful, that we have had. This\nbook owes a great deal to these people. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to\nEcole des Mines de Saint Etienne, which has for many years given me the means to\ncarry out my work and enabled the achievement of this book.\nMichel SOUSTELLE\nSaint Vallier\nMay 2011\n\nPART 1\nBasic Concepts of\nChemical Kinetics\n\nChapter 1\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities\nThis first chapter devoted to chemical kinetics, should provide us with\ndefinitions of specific notions that are the extents and speeds of reactions every time\nwe approach a new field of disciplinary paradigms. This description is particularly\nimportant in chemical kinetics because many definitions are intuitively related to the\nevolution of a reaction system and the speed of this evolution and for which the\nsame word does not always correspond to the same definition according to authors.\nThus we encounter many “speeds” of reaction that are not expressed in the same\nunits and are not always linked with each other. The result is such that when starting\nto read a book – or an article on kinetics – the reader needs to pay particular\nattention to definitions given by the author if indeed he or she has taken the trouble\nto explain them. Therefore we specially draw the reader’s attention to this chapter.\n1.1. The chemical reaction\n1.1.1. The chemical equation and stoichiometric coefficients\nA chemical reaction is the phenomenon that turns an unstable chemical species\nor mixture, under the conditions of chemical experiment, into other stable species. A\nreaction is represented by its chemical equation such as reaction [1.R1], which\nrepresents the reaction between nitric oxide and hydrogen, and produces water and\nnitrogen:\n2NO + 2H = 2H O + N [1.R1]\n2 2 2\n4 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThis chemical equation, besides the chemical species being involved, includes\nnumbers placed in front of each species (e.g. 2 for N ) that are called the arithmetic\n2\nstoichiometric coefficients. The set of coefficients belonging to a reaction may be\nmultiplied or divided by the same number without modifying the reaction in any\nway. For example, the above reaction could also be written by multiplying all the\nstoichiometric coefficients by two in the following:\n4NO + 4H = 4H O + 2N\n2 2 2\nThese coefficients (integer or fractional) indicate the proportions of species that\nare involved in the reaction. For example, in reaction [1.R1] if three moles of nitric\noxide react with three moles of hydrogen respectively, in fine, when the reaction is\ntotally complete it will have produced three moles of water and 1.5 moles of\nnitrogen.\nNOTE 1.1.– During the kinetic study (as for the thermodynamic study) of a\nreaction, it is recommended we choose a set of stoichiometric coefficients and keep\nthem. It is highly recommended to choose the same series for the kinetic and\nthermodynamic study that often precedes it.\nWe state that the chemical equation is a “molar” equation and it should be noted\nthat the two members of the equation are separated by the equals sign.\nIn the case of certain generalizations it is sometimes usual to represent equation\n[1.R1] as [1.R2], which is obtained by passing all the initial chemical species to the\nright-hand side through the application of the algebraic rule of change in sign:\n0 = 2H O + N – 2NO – 2H [1.R2]\n2 2 2\nThe new coefficients 2, 1, -2 and -2 are called algebraic stoichiometric\ncoefficients. It should be noted that they are positive for a product of the reaction and\nnegative for a starting compound.\nGENERALIZATION.– A reaction between the compounds A\n1\n, A\n2,\n[…], A\ni\n…\nproducing species A' , A' […], A' will be generally written as [1.R3], with the\n1 2 j\narithmetic stoichiometric coefficients k or as [1.R4] with the algebraic\nstoichiometric coefficients k :\n A + A +...+ A +...=' A' ' A' ...' A' ...

For example, let us quote state changes like the\nfusion of ice in water, which can be written as:\nH O (ice) = H O (liquid)\n2 2\nor the diffusion of a species A from one point to another within a solution and that\nwill be represented by:\nA (starting point) = A (arrival point)\nIt should be noted that physical transformations frequently involve\nstoichiometric coefficients that are equal to one.\n1.1.2. The reaction components\nWhen a reaction is performed in a vessel called a reactor, at one point the\ndifferent kinds of substances that are called the components of this reaction may be\npresent in this reactor.\nWe keep the definition of the thermodynamics of a component as a specific\nspecies in a specified phase (solid, liquid, gas or solution). From the viewpoint of\nthe kinetics of reactions, it is common to divide these components into four families:\n– Principal components: these are the components that are mentioned in the\nchemical equation and they are subclassified into two categories:\n- reactants (or reagents), which are written on the left-hand side in the\nchemical equation in [1.R3] and are the species introduced into the reactor in order\nto carry out the reaction (such as nitric oxide and hydrogen in reaction [1.R1]); and\n- products, which are written in the right-hand side of the chemical equation\nand are produced by the reaction, such as water and nitrogen in our example.\n6 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n– Catalysts or inhibitors: these components are intentionally added to the reactor\nand can be found among the products of the reaction. They influence the speed at\nwhich the reaction occurs. This influence can be positive (leading to the reaction’s\nacceleration), these are then catalysts; or negative (slowing down the reaction), these\nare inhibitors.\n– Inert components or diluents: these compounds are intentionally introduced to\nthe reactor, for example to adjust the concentrations or the total pressure, but they\nhave no chemical effect on the progress of the reaction. For instance, if we introduce\nargon into reaction [1.R1] occurring in gas phase, the total pressure can be adjusted\nto one atmosphere with insufficient quantities of gas. We must be cautious before\nconsidering a constituent as inert in kinetics and ensure that its presence does not\naffect the progress of the reaction, etc.\n– Intermediary components or intermediates: these species are not introduced\ninto the reactor and are no longer there when the reaction is complete; they are\nproduced and destroyed during the reaction. Their kinetic role is of the utmost\nimportance in the way the reaction occurs.\n1.1.3. Reaction zones\nWe will see (in section 2.1) that many reactions take place in several steps and\nsome of these steps (sort of partial reactions) do not all occur in the reactor’s\nregions.\nThe reaction zones are the regions in space where one part of this reaction\noccurs.\nIf the entire reaction takes place in one specific region of the reactor, we say that\nit is a single zone or monozone reaction. Otherwise it is a multiple zone or multizone\nreaction.\nLet us reconsider reaction [1.R1] in gas phase. It is a single zone reaction\nbecause the entire reaction can take place at any point of the reactor and the reactor\nis the reaction zone.\nNow let us imagine a reaction between gases catalyzed by a solid. This means\nthat the actual reaction only occurs at the surface of the solid. We consider two cases\nhere.\nIn the first case (see Figure 1.1a) the catalyst is not porous and a fluidized bed\nreactor is used. The solid is suspended in the gas in motion and the mixture is\nperfectly stirred. The gas has very easy access to the surface of the solid and the\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 7\nconcentrations of different species far from the catalyst will be the same as those in\nthe vicinity of the surface. We will be dealing with a single zone reaction and the\nsolid surface constitutes the reaction zone.\nFigure 1.1. Catalytic reactor: a) stirred fluidized with nonporous solid; and\nb) closed with porous catalyst\nLet us now consider the same catalytic reaction but with a porous catalyst in a\nclosed reactor with a static gas (Figure 1.1b). The concentrations of the various\ngases away from the solid are not the same as those in the vicinity of the surface\nbecause of the difficulty that gases have in accessing or moving away from the\nsurface. In this case the reaction will display two reaction zones:\n– the catalyst surface where part of the phenomenon occurs; and\n– the rest of the reactor (including the pores of the solid), in which the gases will\ndiffuse, constituting a second zone for the overall reaction.\nThere are frequently more reaction zones in the reactions that involve gases and\nsolids, such as oxygen’s reaction on a metal in order to form an oxide.\nA reaction zone can be a volume, as in the case of reaction [1.R1] in gas phase,\nor a surface, as in the case of heterogeneous catalysis. During a reaction, the\ndimensions of the reaction zones may remain constant or vary due to the reaction.\nFor instance, in the heterogeneous catalysis in [1.R1], the area of the solid’s surface\nis invariable as is the area of the rest of the reactor. Contrary to this, if reaction\n[1.R1] is carried out under constant pressure in gas phase in a deformable reactor,\ndue to the reaction the volume of this reactor and therefore of the zone will decrease.\n8 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n1.2. Homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions\nIn kinetics, a distinction is commonly made between homogeneous reactions, in\nwhich all the components of the reaction belong to the same phase, and\nheterogeneous reactions, where the components of the reaction belong to different\nphases. Thus, in our previous examples, reaction [1.R1] carried out in gas phase is a\nhomogeneous reaction; while the catalytic reaction in Figures 1.1 is a heterogeneous\nreaction. As a component of the reaction, the catalyst alone constitutes a solid phase.\nThis distinction is historic but does not appear to be very useful. In fact, for\nkinetic studies, experience shows us that it is more appropriate to separate single\nzone reactions from multizone reactions. We will see that differences appear at this\nlevel. Thus, in our previous examples we will classify reaction [1.R1] in gas phase\nand the catalytic reaction in Figure 1.1a in the same category of single zone\nreactions; while the reaction presented in Figure 1.1b will be a multizone reaction.\nIn addition to this, it should be noted that the same chemical reaction might occur\nwith a different number of zones depending on the conditions of the experiment.\n1.2.1. Single zone reaction\nThere are two broad classes of reactions that involve a single zone:\n– homogeneous reactions in which all the components (whether principal or not)\nbelong to the same phase. These are then distinguished as:\n- gas phase reactions,\n- reactions between liquids in which all the liquid components are miscible\nwith each other,\n- reactions in solutions, for which the different components (whether principal\nor not) are dissolved in the same solvent. This solvent can be a liquid or a solid that\ndoes not appear in the writing of the chemical equation;\n– elementary reactions or elementary steps that will be defined in Chapter 2.\n1.2.2. Multizone reaction\nThis category gathers together all the heterogeneous reactions that can be divided\ninto two classes:\n– heterogeneous catalytic reactions in which all the components belong to the\nsame phase (typically a gas or a solution) with the exception of the catalyst that\nconstitutes a separate solid phase;\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 9\n– strictly heterogeneous reactions in which at least one condensed phase, usually\na solid, is one of the reactants or products of the reaction.\nA reaction such as the one shown in Figure 1.1a that we have called a single\nzone is actually a heterogeneous reaction with several zones rendered to single zone\nbehavior by the experimental conditions (agitation, solid non-porous).\n1.3. Extent and speed of a reaction\nIn this section we will discuss reaction [1.R1] written as [1.R2], occurring in gas\nphase, and will eventually generalize this using reaction [1.R4] exhibiting, unless\notherwise stated, one or several zones indifferently.\n1.3.1. Stoichiometric abundance of a component in a reaction mixture\nThe stoichiometric abundance of a constituent k in a reaction mixture at a given\ntime is the ratio η of the amount of this component to its arithmetic stoichiometric\ncoefficient, which is defined by:\nA \nk\n  [1.1]\nk\n\nk\nLet us reconsider our example of reaction [1.R1] between nitric oxide and\nhydrogen. We will say that nitric oxide is stoichiometrically more abundant than\nhydrogen if:\nNO H \n2\n   \nNO H\n2 2 2\nSimilarly for the products, nitrogen will be more abundant than water if we have:\nN  H O\n2 2\n   \nN H O\n2 1 2 2\n1.3.2. Extent of a reaction\nIf for a short time interval dt, we perform reaction [1.R1], some of the reactants\nwill be consumed and some of the products will be produced. We will consume, for\nexample, d{NO} moles of nitric oxide and d{H } moles of hydrogen in order to\n2\n10 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nproduce d{H O} moles of water and d{N } moles of nitrogen. If we consider the\n2 2\nstoichiometry ratios between these quantities1 we must have:\ndNO dH  dH O dN \n2 2 2\n= = =\n2 2 2 1\nWe will say that during dt all of these variations of stoichiometric abundances\nare in fact the variation d of a certain function  that we will call the extent of\nreaction [1.R1], and therefore:\ndNO dH  dH O dN \n2 2 2\n   d\n2 2 2 1\nIf we posit that this function is zero when the environment contains only the\nreactants, the extent of the reaction at a time t is:\nt\n  [1.2]\nd\n0\nThe extent is expressed in amounts of substance, i.e. it is given in moles.\nIf we generalize this definition to reaction [1.R3] written as [1.R4], for any\nreactant or product in a closed system with respect to this component we will have:\nd dA\nk\n\n [1.3]\ndt  dt\nk\nAt any time t, if A  is the amount of component A at a time t , applying\nk 0 k 0\n[1.2] to the amount of component A at a time t gives:\nk\nt\nA A   dA     [1.4]\nk k 0 k k 0 k 0\nt\n0\n1 We will see later (in Chapter 5, section 5.2 and Chapter 7, section 7.1.2) that this condition\nis not as obvious as it seems and is not always met.\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 11\nNOTE 1.3.– We consider that the extent is zero when at least one of the reaction’s\nproducts is not present in the mixture. This means that starting at the initial instant t\n0\nof a mixture containing all reactants and products, the initial advancement is 0 .\nLet us reconsider the example of reaction [1.R1] and mix at initial instant t the\n0\ncomponents of the reaction: 2 moles of nitric oxide, 2 moles of hydrogen, 2 moles of\nwater and 2 moles of nitrogen. We want to calculate 0 .\nFirst let us determine the least abundant product of the reaction. It is clear that:\n    N 2  0 2     H 2 O 0  2 1\nN H O\n2 0 1 2 0 2 2\nWe will then calculate the initial extent using the stoichiometric abundance of\nwater, which is the lowest, and therefore:\nH O\n  2 0 1 mole\n0\n2\nWe can now calculate the composition of the mixture when the reactor does not\ncontain water by applying equation [1.4]:\nNO=2+2=4 moles; H =2+2=4 moles\n2\nN =21=1 mole\n2\nThe variation of the amount of A in the open system is due on one hand to the\nk\nreaction and on the other hand to the algebraic sum of the currents q (input and\nA\noutput) of the constituent:\ndA\nk\n\n\nd\n  q   q [1.5]\nk A A\ndt dt\ninput output\n1.3.3. Speed of a reaction\nThe speed of a reaction (v ), sometimes called the absolute speed, is the derivative\na\nin relation to time of the extent of this reaction, so we will write:\nd\nv v (t) [1.6]\na a\ndt\n12 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nA reaction speed is measured in moles per second.\nThe application of relation [1.2] immediately leads to the extent at time t:\nt\n  v (t) [1.7]\n0 a\nt\n0\nThrough [1.4] we obtain the amount of any principal component of the reaction\nat the same time in a closed zone:\nt\nA A   v (t)dt [1.8]\nk k 0 k a\nt\n0\nThe exchange of the components between the zone and the exterior must be\ntaken into account in the open zone, and therefore:\nt t\nA A   v (t)dt q (t)dt [1.9]\nk k 0 k a k\nt t\n0 0\n1.4. Volumetric and areal speed of a monozone reaction\nThe reaction speed in a monozone reaction is proportional at each moment to the\nvolume (or surface in the case of a surface zone) of the zone concerned at this\ninstant. For instance, for the gas phase of reaction [1.R1], the reaction volume is the\nvolume of the reactor that contains the gaseous constituents of the reaction.\nIn the case of a surface zone (a 2D zone), the reaction volume is given by the\nproduct of its area with the thickness of this zone. The latter has the same order of\nmagnitude as the molecule’s sizes and is not likely to change during the reaction. To\ncharacterize the dimension of the zone we will define a reaction surface in this case.\nIn the case of the catalytic reaction in Figure 1.1a, the reaction surface is the area of\nthe total surface of the grains of the catalyst solid.\nAn expansion coefficient (z) of a product B with respect to a reactant A is the\nratio of the volume of B at any time to the volume of A that has produced it:\nV\nz B mB [1.10]\nV\nA mA\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 13\nHere V and V are the molar volumes of A and B, and  and  are the\nmA mB A B\narithmetic stoichiometric coefficients of A and B in the reaction being studied.\nThis ratio does not vary with the extent of the reaction. This ratio is not useful for\ngaseous phases because all the gases have the same molar volume. It is interesting,\nhowever, in the case of solid–solid reactions such as, for example, the expansion\ncoefficient of an oxide with respect to its metal.\nThe volumetric speed of a single-zone reaction is the speed of the reaction per\nunit of volume (the areal speed will be used for 2D zones). We emphasize that this\nnotion is only defined for reactions with a single reaction zone, which includes all\nhomogeneous reactions, in other words that occur entirely in one phase:\nv v V or [1.11a]\na\nv v S [1.11b]\na\nThe volumetric speed (areal speed) is thus expressed in moles per second and m3\n(moles per second and m2). This magnitude is a priori based on the extent of the\nreaction (among others like temperature, concentration of the reactants, etc.) and\ntherefore time, but is independent of the volume (or the surface) of the zone.\nConsidering equations [1.3] and [1.11a] (or [1.11b]), we obtain:\n– in a closed zone:\n1 dA \nk\nv [1.12a]\nV dt\nk\nor:\n1 dA \nk\nv [1.12b]\nS dt\nk\n– in open zone for the component concerned:\n \n1 1\ndA \nv  k   q   q  [1.13]\nV dt A A\n k input output \n14 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n1.5. Fractional extent and rate of a reaction\n1.5.1. The fractional extent of a reaction\nThe fractional extent of a reaction is a very practical notion because it defines a\ndimensionless quantity. The definition of the notion of fractional extent leads us to\nconsider three cases.\n1.5.1.1. Closed reactors with respect to the principal components of the reaction\nSuch a reactor does not exchange any substance with its surroundings. At the\ninitial moment it contains a certain amount of reactants and the stoichiometrically\nleast abundant reactant in reaction [1.R3] is the constituent denoted A1.\nThe fractional extent () of the reaction is the ratio of the actual extent to the\ninitial amount of the stoichiometrically less abundant reactant:\n\n [1.14]\nA\n1 0\nFor example, let us reconsider reaction [1.R1] with 4 moles of nitric oxide and 6\nmoles of hydrogen at the start. The stoichiometrically least abundant compound is\nthe nitric oxide, as 4/2 is less than 6/2. According to [1.11], the fractional extent will\nbe:\n \n \nNO 4\n0\nThrough a combination of equations [1.4] and [1.14] in a closed zone we obtain:\nA A   A   [1.15]\nk k 0 k 1 0 0\nThe difference A  A  is the lost quantity of a reactant and its opposite is\nk 0 k\nthe amount of a product produced.\n0 = 0 is mostly chosen if at least one of the products formed by the reaction is\nmissing.\nThe application of equation [1.15] to the components of reaction [1.R1] gives:\nNONO 2NO NO (12)4(12)\n0 0 0\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 15\nH =H  2NO 68\n2 2 0 0\nH O=H O 2NO a=2NO 8\n2 2 0 0 0\nN =N  +NO =NO =4\n2 2 0 0 0\nFrom this we can see that the fractional extent is zero if only the reactants are\npresent and is one when the reaction is terminated by the complete disappearance of\nthe least abundant reactant. Therefore, this dimensionless number varies at most\nbetween zero and one in a closed reactor.\nIf the reaction is balanced, it means that the equilibrium corresponds to a certain\nfractional extent e and that if we apply the mass-action law, we can write:\nA  k K A   A    k\nk c k 0 k 1 0 e\nk k\nNOTE 1.4.– If we apply equation [1.15] to the reference reactant A1, we get:\n1 A 1 A 1  0\n [1.16]\n A\n1 1 0\nWe note from equation [1.16] that the fractional extent represents the portion of\nthe reference reactant that has reacted if its stoichiometric coefficient is one (which\ncan often be chosen). Hence the name “fractional conversion” is sometimes used to\nrefer to the fractional extent of a reaction.\n1.5.1.2. Closed reactors with respect to one or more reactants of the reaction\nIf the reactor is closed or partially closed with respect to one or more\ncomponents, the stoichiometrically least abundant component will be chosen. We\ncan again apply definition [1.14] and equation [1.15] in order to calculate the\nquantities of different species lost or produced when the system is closed to the\nfractional extent .\n16 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n1.5.1.3. Completely open reactors\nThe concept of the initial amount of a reactant is meaningless in an open system.\nIn order to maintain the dimensionless character of a fractional extent, it will be\n0\ndefined from a random amount of substance n of one of the components A . So,\n1 1\ninstead of [1.14] and [1.15], we will get the expressions:\n\n [1.17]\n0\nn\n1\nt\nA A   n 0 ( ) q .dt\nk k 0 k 1 0 k [1.18]\nt\n0\nThis definition of the fractional extent does not impose any upper bound.\n1.5.2. Rate of a reaction\nIn order to maintain the intensive nature of the speed of a reaction, we will\ndefine a new form of speed that is the speed of the fractional extent or rate as the\nderivative of the fractional extent with respect to time:\nd  v\nr  a or a [1.19]\ndt A n 0\n1 0 1\nNOTE 1.5.– Most books do not give a specific name to this quantity, which is a\nreaction frequency. They just call it “speed”. Other books use the term “rate” for the\nabsolute speed, which increases confusion.\n1.5.3. Expression of the volumetric speed (areal) from variations in the amount of\na component\nWe consider a reactor where a single reaction is carried out. Through equations\n[1.3] and [1.19], for any type of reaction in a closed environment we can write:\ndA \nk  v  A r [1.20]\ndt k a k 1 0\nIf our reaction is a single-zone reaction, taking into account [1.12] yields:\ndA  1 dA \nk k\n v.V or v [1.21]\nk\ndt  V dt\nk\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 17\nIf several independent reactions are now carried out in our reactor that involve\ncomponent A as the reactant or the product, with the algebraic stoichiometric\nk\ncoefficient k in the -th reaction, the balance of this component – considering only\nthe reactions – will be:\ndA \nk  v  A  r [1.22]\ndt k a ρ 1 0 kρ ρ\n \nBefore applying this equation, it is important that the reactions considered are\ntruly independent. In order to illustrate this, let us consider a reactor containing the\nfollowing gas constituents: oxygen, nitric oxide and water. From these compounds\nwe can write the following three reactions:\n2NO + H = H O + N [1.R1]\n2 2 2\nNO + 1/2O = NO [1.R5]\n2 2\nH + 1/2O = H O [1.R6]\n2 2 2\nWe note that reaction [1.R6] can be obtained by the following linear combination\nof the above reactions:\n[1.R6] = [1.R1] + 2  [1.R5]\nThis reaction is not independent of the other two and therefore we will only keep\nreactions [1.R1] and [1.R5].\nThe application of equation [1.22] to nitric oxide is written as:\ndNO\nNO 2r r \ndt 0 1 2\nEquation [1.22] can be written as [1.23] by introducing the volume V of the\nzone:\ndA \nk A  v V [1.23]\ndt 1 0 k \n\n18 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe see that the mixture behaves as if it is the seat of a single reaction whose\nspecific speed is the combination of the independent reactions’ specific speeds:\nv  [1.24]\nkρ ρ\nρ\nA current of matter q of component k is exchanged with the exterior (incoming\nk\nand/or outgoing) in an open system and equation [1.20] is replaced by:\ndA \nk  v q  A rq [1.25]\ndt k a k k 1 0 k\nEquation [1.21] is replaced in single-zone system by:\ndA \nk  vV q  A rq [1.26]\ndt k k k 1 0 k\nRelation [1.22] is replaced by:\ndA \nk  v  q n  r q [1.27]\ndt k, a ρ k 0 kρ ρ k\n \nand [1.23] becomes:\ndA \nk V v q [1.28]\nk,  k\ndt\n\n1.6. Reaction speeds and concentrations\nDuring the study of numerous reactions occurring in solution, the measurement\nof concentrations is frequently used.\n1.6.1. Concentration of a component in a zone\nConcentration in a reaction zone is defined as the amount of substance contained\nin the unit volume of this area. In the case of homogeneous and uniform reactions, a\ncomponent will only have one concentration:\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 19\nA \nA  k [1.29]\nk\nV\nIn the case of 2D zones, the concept of superficial concentration is sometimes\nused, which is the amount of substance contained on a unit area of a surface.\n1.6.2. Relationship between concentration and fractional extent in a closed\nenvironment\nIf the zone is closed with respect to component A , the only cause of variation in\nk\nconcentration over time is the reaction and, therefore, by using equations [1.15] and\n[1.29] and by assigning the index zero to the magnitude values at the start of a\nreaction, we get:\nV\nA A   A    0 [1.30]\nk k 0 k 1 0 0 V\nIn the case of gaseous components, assuming an ideal gas, the concentration can\nbe replaced by the partial pressure by using:\nP A RT [1.31]\nk k\nIf several reactions involving the same constituent k, whose stoichiometric\ncoefficient in the -th reaction is k occur in the same zone, then equation [1.30]\nbecomes:\nA  V\nA A   1 0 0      [1.32]\nk k 0 V kρ ρ ρ 0\nρ\n1.7. Expression of volumetric speed according to variations in concentration in\na closed system\nFrom the concentration expression [1.29], through derivation we obtain:\ndA  1 dA  A dV\nk k k\n  [1.33]\ndt V dt V dt\n20 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nand by using [1.12] and [1.32] for a reaction with a single zone, we get:\n1 dA  A dV\nk k\nv  [1.34]\n dt V dt\nk\nThis relationship is extremely useful for the computation of the volumetric speed\nof a reaction from concentration measurements in a closed system.\nIt should be noted that if the reaction zone maintains a constant volume during\nthe progress of the reaction, expression [1.34] is simplified to:\n1 dA \nk\nv [1.35]\n dt\nk\nThis will be the case for all homogeneous reactions in gaseous phase in a closed\nenvironment with constant volume and in numerous homogeneous reactions in\nliquid or solid phase (solutions) for which variations in volume will be negligible.\n1.8. Stoichiometric mixtures and progress\nWe say that two reactants, m and k, are in stoichiometric proportion if they have\nthe same stoichiometric abundance (see section 1.3.1), which means their amounts\nare such that:\nA k   k\n [1.36]\nA  \nm m\nIn closed system, if these conditions are met at a moment of reaction they are\nmet at all times2, especially at the initial moment.\nThe same ratio as [1.36] is obtained for the concentrations by dividing the\namounts of substance by the same volume:\nA k   k\n [1.37]\nA  \nm m\n2 See Note 1.5 in section 1.5.2.\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 21\nBy defining a ratio, k , we still have the right to write the initial amount of a\nproduct as:\nA   A [1.38]\nk 0 k 1 0\nIn the case of two products m and k of the reaction that are in stoichiometric\nproportion, their amounts satisfy equation [1.36]. As they were already in these\nproportions at the initial moment we obtain:\n \nk k\n [1.39]\n \nm m\nIf all the products of a reaction are in stoichiometric proportions, then the ratio\n/ is invariant and, according to [1.15], its value is the fractional extent at the initial\nstate:\n\nk constant\n0\n\nk\n1.9. Factors influencing reaction speeds\nMany variables can influence the speed of a reaction. Their number cannot be\nknown a priori, so they need to be determined by experience. The two main\nvariables are:\n– temperature;\n– concentrations (or partial pressures of gas) of reactants, products or catalysts.\n1.9.1. Influence of temperature\nThe influence of temperature on the speed of reactions was found very early on\nin chemistry. In general the speed of a reaction increases with temperature, but\nexceptions to this rule are known (for instance reaction [1.R5] between nitric oxide\nand oxygen in order to obtain nitrogen dioxide has a speed that decreases as the\ntemperature increases).\n22 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe laws are often complex but a representation of experimental points giving\nthe logarithm of speed versus the inverse of temperature (known as Arrhenius\ncoordinates) quite often lead to a straight line (see Figure 1.2). This suggests that\nArrhenius’ law, which can take one of the three forms – [1.40], [1.41] or [1.42] – is\nfollowed. This appearance is often misleading, however, and it frequently comes\nfrom the strong influence of temperature in a restricted range of the temperature and\nfrom the linearizing properties of Arrhenius coordinates:\n\nv Aexp [1.40]\nRT\ndlnv \n [1.41]\ndln(1/T) R\ndlnv \n [1.42]\ndln(1/T) RT 2\nThe consequence is that experimenters often confine themselves to this raw\nresult. The computed parameter  is often called the activation energy of the\nreaction. This definition is also used for a particular class of reactions, which will be\ncalled elementary reactions (see Chapter 2), with a precise physical meaning that is\nnot found for the other types of equations. In the general case and in the absence of\nany additional information, we prefer to call this parameter the “temperature\ncoefficient”, which is thus defined from the experiment by:\n1 lnv\n [1.43]\nR (1/T)\nln v\n1/T\nFigure 1.2. Variation of the speed of a reaction in Arrhenius coordinates\nChemical Reaction and Kinetic Quantities 23\nNOTE 1.6.– In a reactor, this is mainly true in industrial reactors, the temperature\nis not always the same at all points and thus the speeds differ both in time and space.\n1.9.2. Influence of the concentrations (or partial pressures of gases)\nThe relationships between reaction speed and concentrations of reactants,\nproducts or catalysts are extremely complex and varied. We will see that the\ndiversity of these relations is a real treasure and makes speed–concentration\nrelationships at constant temperature the main tool of justification for a mechanism.\nIt should be noted that equations of the following form are sometimes\nencountered:\nvkA  1A  2...  A  i [1.44]\n1 2 i\nThis function only involves the concentrations of the reactants. In this case we\nsay that the reaction admits an order that is the sum of the exponents, i , that are\nthemselves partial orders. The “constant” k would only depend on the temperature.\nIn the case of closed reactors, we must keep in mind that the concentrations vary\nsolely because of the reaction and therefore evolve with its progress so that the\ninfluence of the concentration implicitly contains two distinct variables: the\nconcentration and the extent.\nIt should be noted that the concentrations can be kept constant throughout the\nreaction by working in an open reactor with a regulated supply but also by working\nduring sufficiently short times with high concentrations so that the variations in\nconcentrations become fairly insignificant. In these cases, the concentration is\ndetached from the extent.\n1.9.3. Other variables\nThe previous variables are dominant and are called thermal variables. Other\nvariables exist, however, that it is sometimes appropriate to examine. This is, for\ninstance, the wavelength and the light intensity in “photochemical” reactions, which\nare influenced by light, or the electric potential in “electrochemical” reactions,\nwhich involve electrons as a reactant or a product of the reaction. Extensive\nvariables should be added to these intensive variables, such as the amounts of\nsubstance, the shapes and dimensions of reaction zones and reactors.\n\nChapter 2\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps\nApart from being of practical interest, which is linked to the notion of yield,\nchemical kinetics provides information on how the reaction takes place, which is\ncalled its mechanism. Starting from a basic premise of the decomposition of real\nreactions into elementary steps, we are led to examine the different types of\nelementary steps that will form the basic tools that will help us to understand the\nprogress of the reaction being studied.\n2.1. Basic premise of kinetics\nIt can easily be thought that, in order to react with each other, molecules have to\nbe very close to each other at a given time. This means they must positioned so that\nthey exert mutual influences that can provoke changes.\nLet us consider the reaction forming water:\n2 H + O  2 H O [2.R1]\n2 2 2\nThis reaction involves three molecules as reactants. It is clear that if this reaction\noccurred in a single step, it would imply that the three molecules (reagents) meet (or\nare very close to each other) at the same time to give rise to a reaction that is\nfollowed by the simultaneous transfer of two electrons. This situation is thought to\nbe unlikely. Indeed the probability of collision of three gas molecules can be\ncalculated through the kinetic theory of gases and is very low, certainly well below\nthe number of molecules that react per second, which can be obtained from the\nreaction speed that readily becomes explosive. We therefore prefer a path that is a\n26 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nbit more complicated, but would make a minimum transformation at each step. Each\nof these steps will be called an elementary step.\nNOTE 2.1.– The above reaction could have been written by dividing the\nstoichiometric coefficients by two, which would have led to the necessity for only\ntwo molecules to collide – a phenomenon that is much more common and sufficient\nwith regard to the order of magnitude of reaction speeds. Such a collision will have\nproduced half a nitrogen molecule, however, which is unacceptable given that there\nis no such thing as half a water molecule.\nSuch observations can be made for a large number of reactions, which leads us to\nadmit the following premise that can be considered to be the fundamental principle\nof kinetics.\nPRINCIPLE.– Any real reaction is a more or less complex combination of\nelementary steps.\n2.2. Reaction mechanism\n2.2.1. Definition\nA mechanism is a set of elementary reactions that adequately reflect the progress\nof a reaction.\nTherefore, a mechanism is an assumption that must be consistent with all\navailable experimental observations.\nThe existence of “intermediate” elementary reactions implies the existence of\nnew species that will be termed “intermediate species”. Such intermediate species\nare not present in the balanced writing of the reaction, which implies that their\namount is zero both at the initial and the final state. Thus, these intermediate species\nwill be produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others.\nSo if we reconsider reaction [2.R1], the mechanism that consists of the six steps\n[2.R1a], [2.R1b], [2.R1c], [2.R1d], [2.R1e] and [2.R1f] was proposed. It follows that\nthis mechanism suggests the intermediate formation of OH radicals and atoms of\nhydrogen and oxygen:\nH + O  2OH [2.R1a]\n2 2\nHO + H  H O + H [2.R1b]\n2 2\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 27\nO + H  OH + H [2.R1c]\n2\nH + O  OH + O [2.R1d]\n2\nOH + H  H O [2.R1e]\n2\nOH + OH  H + O [2.R1f]\n2 2\nNOTE 2.2.– It should be noted that in an elementary reaction, the equals sign (=)\nbetween the reactants and the products is replaced by a double arrow (), which\nmeans that we are dealing with two opposite elementary reactions. A single arrow\n(→) is often used in order to indicate the preferred direction of progress of the\nreaction. So, a chemical equation with arrows, for an elementary step, is a\n“molecular” equation (then the molecules can be cut). This is not a “molar” equation\nlike the classical chemical reactions.\n2.2.2. Examples of mechanisms\nThere are several types of mechanisms: unique sequence mechanisms, chain\nmechanisms and catalytic mechanisms. While some are specific to a single reaction,\nothers are applicable to a family of reactions. We will give examples of these\nvarious types and some will serve as the guiding concept in order to present the\ndifferent modes of treatment. We will give more information on mechanisms and\ndetails about the kinds of elementary reactions in Chapter 9.\n2.2.2.1. Hydrogen bromide synthesis\nThe overall reaction is simply written as:\nH + Br = 2HBr [2.R2]\n2 2\nIn a simplified form, the mechanism of this reaction can be formulated through\nthe four steps [2.R2a], [2.R2n], [2.R2c] and [2.R2d]\nBr → 2Br [2.R2a]\n2\nBr + H → HBr + H [2.R2b]\n2\nH + Br → HBr + Br [2.R2c]\n2\nBr + Br → Br [2.R2d]\n2\nIt should be noted that the last step is the opposite reaction of the first step.\n28 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n2.2.2.2. Dinitrogen pentoxide (N O ) decomposition\n2 5\nThe thermal decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide in nitrogen dioxide and\noxygen (reaction [2.R3]) is a unique sequence reaction with a mechanism that\nconsists of the three steps [2.R3a], [2.R3b] and [2.R3c]:\n2N O = 4NO + O [2.R3]\n2 5 2 2\nN O  NO + NO [2.R3a]\n2 5 2 3\nNO + NO  NO + NO + O [2.R3b]\n2 3 2 2\nNO + NO  2NO [2.R3c]\n3 2\nThe aforementioned examples are mechanisms that are specific to a reaction.\nHowever, there are templates of mechanisms that are common to a significant\nnumber of similar reactions.\n2.2.2.3. Nucleophilic substitution reactions in organic chemistry\nThese reactions can be divided into two categories, each leading to a mechanism:\nthe SN1 mechanism (so called because it leads to a speed of first order) with two\nsteps in the mechanism, such as reaction [2.R4] and steps [2.R4a] and [2.R4b]:\nt – BuCl + OH–↔ t – BuOH + Cl– [2.R4]\ntBuCl tBu Cl\n[2.R4a]\ntBu OH tBuOH\n[2.R4b]\nand the SN2 mechanism (so-called because it leads to a speed of second order) in a\nsingle step, as in reaction [2.R5]:\nPh-CHCl + HCH O-Ph-CH-CH3\n2 [2.R5]\nOCH\nWe can also mention electrophilic substitution reactions, which are divided into\ntwo classes: SE1 in two steps and SE2 in a single step.\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 29\n2.3. Reaction intermediates\nOnce the principle that breaks down a reaction into elementary steps is accepted,\nit is clear that apart from the reactants – such as catalysts and inhibitors – and the\nproducts eventually formed, new species are involved in these elementary steps, as\nshown by the examples we have given. These species are probably particularly\nreactive because we can only rarely detect and identify them.\nThe intermediates involved in the progress of reactions can be activated atoms or\nmolecules, which are those that have acquired an additional energy making them\nhighly reactive, but mostly entities featuring free valences in the form of unpaired\nelectrons, radicals or electric charge, or ions. Finally, in kinetics involving solids, we\nfind adsorbed molecules or atoms, since adsorption is a kind of activation. We can\nalso find point defects in crystals, which are highly mobile species as often shown\nby electrical conductivity, and therefore likely to move to ensure the transport of\nmatter and charges.\n2.3.1. Excited atoms (or molecules)\nIf we consider a set of atoms or molecules of the same nature, it is known that\nthey store energy that is distributed into various forms:\n– translation;\n– rotation;\n– vibration;\n– electronic.\nAt rest and at a certain temperature, these forms present an energy that has a\nGaussian shape with a mean value and a standard deviation that increases with\ntemperature. It is possible by various methods to provide energy well above the\naverage to a relatively significant number of these atoms or molecules. The essential\nactivation methods are:\n– thermal activation: a rise in temperature increases the mean energy but also, as\nwe have said, the deviation around this mean so that a certain number of these atoms\n(or molecules) – the most energetic – can acquire an energy that is much higher than\nthe average;\n– electromagnetic activation: the energy is transmitted to the atoms or molecules\nby a beam of particles (photons, electrons, ions, etc.). In photochemistry, for\ninstance, the excitation is provided by light radiation (visible or ultraviolet), the\nmolecules are cut through an electron beam in a mass spectrograph, etc. Such\n30 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nreactions are characterized by their quantum yield, which is the ratio of the number\nof transformed molecules to the number of photons absorbed. This activation leads\nto photochemistry;\n– electrical activation: energy is provided by the electric current. These reactions\nare characterized by Faraday’s law, which enables us to determine the number of\nelectrolyzed molecules for a given amount of electricity. This activation leads to\nelectrochemistry;\n– activation through ultrasound: in liquid or solid phase, the ultrasounds are\nlikely to activate molecules. This activation leads to sonometry;\n– activation through adsorption: the adsorption of molecules coming from a gas\nor liquid at the surface of a solid provokes activations that result in changes in the\nmolecule. An example is the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen, which cuts the\nmolecule into two adsorbed atoms. This activation leads to heterogeneous catalysis.\n2.3.2. Free radicals\nFree radicals are unstable molecules; the instability is due to the presence of\nunpaired or extremely available electrons. For instance, the pyrolysis of tetraethyl\nlead releases ethyl radicals:\n.\nPb(C H ) = Pb(C H ) + 2 C H [2.R6]\n2 5 4 2 5 2 2 5\nThe tert-butyl peroxide is a compound formed from a relatively weak central\nbond O–O: (CH ) COOC(CH ) It is thus a product that, even at ordinary\n3 3 3 3.\ntemperature, tends to break down slowly. It therefore generates free radicals:\n(CH ) CO, that are likely to initiate reactions.\n3 3 °\nThe presence of unpaired electrons should be symbolized by a point that follows\nthe radical’s formula. The simplest form of the radical is an atom, such as the\nchlorine atom represented by the symbol Cl.\n°\nIn some cases, the study of molecular spectrums enables us to demonstrate the\npresence of radicals. Mass spectrometry also constitutes a valuable guide for the\nidentification of radicals or atoms.\n2.3.3. Ions\nThe anions and cations involve two types of reactions. The first is\nelectrochemistry, with the ions in solid or liquid solutions, and gas chemistry, in\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 31\nwhich many reactions involve ions such as the carbocations in organic chemistry.\nWe have already seen the example of the tertbutyl cation, t-Bu+, occurring in\nreaction [2.R4]. Here again spectrography and mass spectrometry are valuable\nmethods for identifying gas-phase ions. In solution, notably in polar solvents such as\nwater, ions are usually solvated, which means they are surrounded by a crown of\nsolvent molecules. The number of solvent molecules surrounding the ion is called\nthe solvation index.\n2.3.4. Adsorbed species\nAll heterogeneous catalysis relies on the existence of reactions between adsorbed\nmolecules or atoms (the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism) or between adsorbed\nmolecules or atoms and free molecules (the Rideal mechanism).\n2.3.5. Point defects\nHeterogeneous reactions involving the stoichiometric participation of solids\nintroduces point defects that are imperfections in the periodic arrangement of the\natoms or ions of a crystal (see Annex 1). The main point defects are:\n– the vacancies: absence of an ion or atom at a point lattice in the crystal;\n– the interstitials: these are atoms or ions inserted between the point lattices of\nthe crystal.\n2.3.6. The effect of intermediates on extent and speeds\nLet us return to the definitions of the extent and speed of a reaction (see section\n1.3). We have implicitly admitted that there a “stoichiometry” relationship exists\nbetween the extent (and speeds) of a reaction, which is defined for each of the\nprincipal components of the reaction as:\nd{A } d{A } d{A }\n1 = 2 = 3 =...=dx [2.1]\nv v v\n1 2 3\nIf different steps exist, and therefore there are intermediate species in the\nprogress of this reaction, nothing says that the various ratios of relation [2.1] are\nequal to each other. In fact, some periods might exist during which the amount of an\nintermediate can increase and other periods might exist when it will decrease.\nTherefore the speeds of the different elementary steps (for which relation [2.1] is\n32 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nfully met, as there is no intermediate in these steps) will not necessarily be equal.\nThis means that the ratios of relation [2.1] will not be equal.\nLet us reconsider the example of reaction [2.R3]. Let us suppose that during a\ncertain period, step [2.R3a] is faster than step [2.R3b]. It is clear that during this\nperiod we will produce more nitric dioxide molecules than oxygen molecules, but\nnothing implies that the ratio one to four is observed.\nIt follows that the rate should be defined as an extent  of each principal\nk\ncomponent of the reaction. Thus the speed (hence the rate) of the reaction with\nrespect to each component will not generally be equal.\nIt is only during periods in which all the amounts of the intermediate species\nremain constant that there will be a single extent and a single speed for the reaction\nregardless of the constituent chosen to define them. In such cases, we will say that\nwe are in steady state conditions for the intermediates.\n2.4. Reaction sequences and Semenov representation\n2.4.1. Semenov diagram\nIn order to sketch a mechanism, we use the Semenov representation (see\nFigure 2.1), where each intermediate compound (M or M ) is represented by a point\n1 2\nthat will constitute a node of the network. Two nodes, the second resulting from the\nfirst through an elementary step, are connected by a vector that indicates the\ndirection of the reaction (step 1). In addition, some steps of the mechanism produce\nor consume intermediates by involving only the principal components of the\nreaction (step 2 in Figure 2.1). These steps are represented by an oriented arc ending\nat or starting from a node.\nM M … …\n1 2 +M →M + (1)\n1 2\n(2)\n…→M (2)\n1\n(1)\nFigure 2.1. Semenov representation of elementary steps\nNOTE 2.3.– The previous steps are likely to involve some principal components\nin one of each member. These components are represented by dots in chemical\nequations.\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 33\n2.4.2. Linear sequences and multipoint sequences\nA set of steps that are linked by a mechanism constitutes a sequence\ncharacterized by its entry point(s), its exit point(s) and its traversal direction(s).\nDepending on the reaction intermediates, two types of sequence are distinguished:\nlinear sequences and multipoint sequences. From the perspective of the Semenov\ndiagram’s shape, two types of sequence are distinguished: open sequences and\nclosed sequences.\n2.4.2.1. Linear sequences\nA sequence is linear if each intermediate is produced by a single step and is also\nconsumed by a single step. Depending on the Semenov representation (see Figure\n2.2), there are:\n– simple linear sequences: The mechanism SN1 of reaction [2.R4] is an example\nof a simple linear system;\n– sequences with convergent paths that present an output disruption. The two\nsimple linear sub-sequences that it is composed of converge at the output;\n– sequences with divergent paths, which present an input disruption. The two\nsimple linear sub-sequences that compose it diverge at the output.\nFigure 2.2. Different types of linear sequences\n2.4.2.2. Multipoint sequences\nA multipoint sequence comprises an intermediate that is produced or consumed\nby at least two steps (see Figure 2.3):\n– if the steps go toward the multipoints then the sequence is convergent;\n– if not, the sequence is divergent.\n34 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFigure 2.3. Multipoint sequences\n2.4.2.3. Cyclic sequences\nThe Semenov diagram shows a cycle that has either parallel branches (see\nFigure 2.4) or is traversed in a single direction.\nFigure 2.4. Closed system with a parallel loop\n2.5. Chain reactions\n2.5.1. Definition\nA chain reaction is a reaction in which a small number of elementary steps are\nrepeated a large number of times following each other through a small number of\nintermediate species that are constantly formed and destroyed. Such an example is\ngiven by the mechanism of the synthesis of hydrogen bromide, expressed in section\n2.2. A repetitive sequence is called a repeat unit in the chain (like the two steps\n[2.R2a] and [2.R2b] in hydrogen bromide synthesis).\nBy extension, a simple linear reaction consisting of a large number of steps very\nclose to each other is also called a chain reaction. Thus, polymerization and\npolycondensation reactions (see section 2.6.5) are also considered to be chain\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 35\nreactions. Each step is very similar to the previous step because each time just a\nsmall entity is added in the molecular chain.\n2.5.2. The different categories of chain reactions\nIn homogeneous kinetics, chain reactions can be grouped into three broad\ngroups:\n– reactions involving halogens or their derivatives;\n– oxidation and combustion reactions (hydrogen, hydrocarbons);\n– reactions involving the formation of macromolecules (polymerization and\npolycondensation).\nThe first two groups are real chain reactions with repetition of intermediates,\nwhile in the third group the intermediates are slightly different as the chain grows.\n2.5.3. The steps in a chain reaction\nIn a chain reaction we are led to distinguish four types of sequences:\n– the initiation steps that create the first intermediate, such as [2.R2a] of\nhydrogen bromide synthesis (section 2.2.2.1);\n– the propagation steps. These are the steps that are reproduced a large number\nof times and are the main consumers of reagent, such as [2.R2b] and [2.R2c] of the\nhydrogen bromide synthesis;\n– the breaking steps. These steps destroy intermediates, which leads to the\ntermination of the chain, as in [2.R2d] of hydrogen bromide synthesis;\n– the branching steps. These are steps that produce two intermediates that each\ngive rise to a chain. Step [2.R1d] of water synthesis is an example.\nThe first three phases are the minimum necessary.\n2.5.4. Sequence of chain reactions\nChain reactions are reactions that have a closed sequence in which the loop is\ntraversed completely in one direction, such as the hydrogen bromide synthesis in\nwhich the sequence constituting the repeat unit (reaction sequence that is repeated\nindefinitely) is linear (see Figure 2.5).\n36 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nH\nBr\nFigure 2.5. Cycle of the repeat unit of HBr synthesis\nIn branched chain reactions, such as water synthesis, the repeat unit includes\nmultipoint sequences (see Figure 2.7), which leads to multiple loops nested within\neach other.\nO\nOH\nH\nFigure 2.6. Semenov cycle of the branched chain reaction\nof water synthesis\n2.5.5. Reactions of macromolecule formation\nMacromolecules are formed by two types of chain reactions: polymerizations\nand polycondensations.\n2.5.5.1. Polymerizations\nPolymerization involves a series of reactions, each adding a simple molecule to\nan already polymerized molecule. An example is the polymerization of ethylene,\nwhere the propagation step is a series of additions of ethylene molecules:\n...-CH CH CH °+CH =CH\n2 2 2 2 2\n[2.R7]\n...CH CH CH CH CH °\n2 2 2 2 2\nSuch a reaction may involve either a single simple molecule, as in the previous\nexample, or alternatively several different simple molecules; the latter situation is\ncalled copolymerization.\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 37\n2.5.5.2. Polycondensations\nPolycondensation occurs like polymerization with a series of reactions where\neach adds a pattern to the chain. Instead of a simple addition, however, there is an\nelimination of a small molecule at each step (water, ammonia, etc.). An example is\nthe production of nylon through polycondensation between adipic acid and\nhexamethylenediamine with the elimination of water:\n\nHN(CH\n2\n) 6NH-CO-(CH\n2\n) 4NH(CH\n2\n) 6NH 2HOOC(CH\n2\n) 4COOH\n\nHN(CH\n2\n) 6NHCO(CH\n2\n) 4CO-NH-(CH\n2\n) 6NHCO(CH\n2\n) 4COOHH\n2\nO\n[2.R8]\nIn both types of reactions (polymerization and polycondensation):\n– if the monomer molecules have two anchor-points, linear molecules will be\nobtained, which are commonly used in the manufacture of threads;\n– if the monomer molecules have three anchor-points, 2D planar molecules will\nbe obtained, which are commonly used in the manufacture of varnishes and paints;\n– if the monomer molecules have more than three anchor-points, spatial\nmolecules are obtained, which are commonly used in the manufacture of synthetic\nresins for molding.\n2.6. Catalytic reactions\nCatalysis is the acceleration of a reaction through the inclusion of an additional\nconstituent: the catalyst.\nTo catalyze a reaction is to change its mechanism in order to reduce its energy\nrequirements. In the simplest case of a regime with one step that determines the\nspeed, catalyzation involves replacing this potentially slow step by an other step that\nhas a lower activation energy.\nAt the end of the reaction, the catalyst is chemically reconstituted and is identical\nto what it was at the beginning of the reaction. This property implies that catalysis\ndoes not change the thermodynamic state functions – such as enthalpy, entropy and\nGibbs free energy – of the reaction.\nNOTE 2.4.– At the end of the reaction, in the case of heterogeneous catalysis,\ndespite the fact that the catalyst is fully regenerated in quantity, its surface can be\ncontaminated by strongly adsorbed species. This makes the surface more difficult to\n38 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\naccess by the reactants. This situation is called catalyst poisoning. Likewise, after\nuse a catalyst may have significant textural differences compared to its initial state.\nAlthough the catalyst is not consumed by the reaction, its amount greatly affects\nthe speed of the catalyzed reaction.\nThere are two areas of catalysis depending on the whether the catalyst belongs to\nthe same phase as the principal constituents or a separate phase (usually a solid).\nThe first case constitutes homogeneous catalysis, mainly in liquid phase. The second\nis heterogeneous catalysis for reactions between catalyzed gases by a solid.\n2.6.1. Homogeneous catalysis\nIn homogeneous catalysis, all the reactants and the catalyst belong to the same\nphase. The most common are catalysts in liquid medium.\n2.6.1.1. Herzfeld mechanism in homogeneous catalysis\nA very general mechanism of homogeneous catalysis has been proposed by\nHerzfeld.\nLet us consider a reaction of the form:\nABEF [2.R9]\nCatalyzed by a substance C, Hertzfeld proposed the following mechanism:\nAC  X 1 X 2 [2.R9a]\nX 1 BEX 3 [2.R9b]\nX 2 X 3  FC [2.R9c]\nIt can be seen that the sum of the three steps [2.R9a], [2.R9b] and [2.R9c] gives\nback the overall reaction.\nNOTE 2.5.– It should be noted in this mechanism that a quadratic step [2.R9c]\nintervenes. This is a step where two intermediates react with one another.\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 39\n2.6.1.2. Enzyme catalysis\nEnzymes are substances present in living organisms. They catalyze most\nbiochemical reactions. These catalysts have three specific properties:\n– an enzyme is very specific to a very particular reaction and this specificity can\neven be stereochemical;\n– enzymes are hydrosoluble substances;\n– enzymes are catalysts that have an optimum temperature of action. The\nexistence of an optimum temperature is due to the fact that enzymes are not stable\nwith temperature and thus this instability counteracts the kinetic effect of\ntemperature.\nA two-step mechanism of enzymatic action was proposed by Michaelis and\nMenten:\n– during the first step, a complex is formed between the enzyme E and the\nsubstrate (reactant) S:\nSEES [2.R10a]\n– this complex is broken down during the second step, which produces the\nproduct P and regenerates the enzyme:\nES SP [2.R10b]\nP\nS ES\nFigure 2.7. Loop of the Michaelis mechanism\n2.6.2. Heterogeneous catalysis\nThis is a reaction between reactants leading to products that usually belong to the\nsame phase (liquid or gas) and utilize the surface of a solid phase in their\nmechanism.\n40 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n2.6.2.1. Heterogeneous catalysis variables\nThe speed of a heterogeneous catalysis reaction generally depends on three\ncategories of variables:\n– the concentrations or partial pressures of reactants and/or products formed;\n– the temperature;\n– the variables related to the catalyst, its nature and the actual area in contact\nwith the gas.\n2.6.2.2. The mechanism of catalysis and the catalytic act\nHeterogeneous catalysis causes a reaction to take place at the surface of a solid\nthrough to the adsorption phenomenon.\nThe full mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis involves five steps:\n– diffusions of reactants in the products toward the surface of the catalyst. The\nreactants are consumed at the catalyst’s surface, resulting in a partial pressure\ngradient between the gas phase (away from the catalyst) and the catalyst’s surface.\nThis gradient is the cause of movement of the gas molecules towards the catalyst,\nwhich is called a diffusion;\n– adsorption of the reactants on the catalyst surface;\n– the catalytic act, which is the chemical reaction itself that also occurs at the\ncatalyst’s surface;\n– desorption of the gases produced at the catalyst’s surface;\n– interdiffusions of gases produced at the catalyst’s surface toward the volume of\ngas and away from the solid. In the same way as for the reagents, but in reverse, the\nreaction creates a partial pressure gradient of the products that are produced at the\ncatalyst’s surface, which leads to diffusion of these products from the surface.\nThe catalytic act, which is the purely chemical part of heterogeneous catalysis,\ncan occur according to two mechanisms:\n– the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism in which the catalytic act is a reaction\nbetween two adsorbed molecules;\n– the Rideal–Elsey mechanism in which the catalytic act is a reaction between an\nadsorbed molecule and a molecule in the gaseous phase.\nReaction Mechanisms and Elementary Steps 41\n2.7. Important figures in reaction mechanisms\nThe men whose work has led to our current understanding of reaction\nmechanisms and who have been awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry are shown in\nFigure 2.8.\nSir Cyril Norman Nikolai Semenov Irving Langmuir\nHinshelwood (1896-1986) (1881-1957)\n(1897-1967) Nobel prize for chemistry Nobel prize for\nNobel prize for chemistry in 1956 chemistry in 1932\nin 1956\nFigure 2.8. Important chemists\n\nChapter 3\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions\nThe science of kinetics is useful for determining mechanisms. The latter justifies\nthe importance given to the kinetic properties of elementary reactions. Indeed, the\nbasic verification of a mechanism will be its resolution, which consists of deducing\nthe kinetic properties of the overall reaction from the kinetic properties of\nelementary steps, in order to compare them with those provided by the experiment.\n3.1. Space function of an elementary reaction\nEach elementary step occurs in a single zone. In fact, if it involves two zones,\nthen one part of the reaction will occur in one zone and the second part in the other.\nIn this case, the reaction would no longer be elementary since it would occur in two\nsteps and at least one intermediate species would be formed between both steps.\nIn an elementary reaction, which occurs in a single zone, the space function of\nthis elementary step is the ratio of the volume (or area) of the reaction zone to the\nreference amount chosen to define the fractional extent:\nV V S S\nE  or or or [3.1]\nn A n A\n0 1 0 0 1 0\nThe space function is expressed in m3 per mole or m2 per mole. The notion of\nspace function is not defined for a non-elementary reaction.\n44 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n3.2. Reactivity and rate of an elementary step\nFrom relations [1.11] and [1.19] we deduce the following relation for a reaction\ninvolving a single zone:\nv.V\nr  [3.2]\nA \n1 0\nThe reactivity  (or chemical flux1 according to Lafitte and Rouquerol) of an\nelementary step is its specific speed. Therefore by using equation [3.1], we obtain\nthe following fundamental relationship:\nr .E [3.3]\nThe rate of an elementary reaction (with a single zone) is the product of its\nreactivity by its space function2. This relation is always true, whether we are dealing\nwith a volume zone or a surface zone.\nThe reactivity is expressed in moles per second per m3 (m2).\nIn the general case, both properties  and E are functions of different parameters\naffecting the speed (temperature, concentrations, partial pressures, pressure, the\nzone’s sizes, amounts of substances, etc.) and fractional extent, and thus time.\nNOTE 3.1.– The need to have a different name for the specific speed of an\nelementary step emerges because this reactivity has a property that the specific\nspeed of a reaction usually does not have. For instance, if the reaction volume of an\nelementary step is doubled, then its rate is also doubled; this is not always the case\nfor a non-elementary reaction. In order to illustrate this, let us reconsider the\nexample of our catalytic reaction in Figure 1.1b and double the reactor’s volume.\nThe reaction speed has no reason to be multiplied by two. So then let us double the\narea of the catalyst. If gas diffusion towards the catalyst occurs, multiplying the area\nof the catalyst by two will not double its speed, thereby the overall speed is not\ndoubled. Later we shall see other properties that distinguish the reactivity of an\nelementary step from a simple specific speed of any kind of reaction.\n1 We do not retain this term because, as discussed in section 3.7.4, it can be confused with the\nflux used in diffusion.\n2 The analogy between this relationship and Ohm’s law, which gives the electrical resistance\nof a wire as the product of its resistivity by a geometric function l/s : R = l/s, should be\nnoticed. The vocabulary used for the “reactivity” stems from the term “resistivity” in this\nanalogy.\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 45\n3.3. Kinetic constants of an elementary step\n3.3.1. Expression of reactivity as a function of concentrations\nAn elementary reaction is a reaction that takes place in a single step in which the\nreactants react directly with each other. It does not involve any intermediate species.\nAn elementary reaction between two species, A and A , will be written as\n1 2\nfollows:\n1 A 1 +2 A 2 →' 1 A' 1 +' 2 A' 2 [3.R1]\nREMINDER.– The arrow (different from the = sign encountered in the writing of a\nreaction) means that we are dealing with an elementary reaction.\nWe have no right to modify the stoichiometric numbers (for example, divided each\nof them by 1 ) as can usually be done in the writing of a reaction because the writing\nof an elementary step reflects the mechanistic reality. This is the concomitant attack\nof 1 molecules of A 1 by 2 molecules of A 2 .\nThe reactivity of an elementary thermal reaction at a given temperature, such as\n[3.R1], obeys van ’t Hoff’s law and is written:\nk[A ] 1[A ] 2 [3.4]\n1 2\nThe quantity k, which does not depend on the concentrations of reactants or\nproducts, is called the rate coefficient (or rate constant). This is less stringent\nbecause this “constant” varies with temperature. 1 and 2 are the partial orders\nwith respect to A 1 and A 2 respectively. The sum  1  2 is called the total order\nof the reaction.\nIt should be noted that the unit of the rate coefficient depends on the total order\nof the reaction.\nThis expression involves only the concentrations of reactants.\nExpression [3.4] does not include condensed reactants that would be pure in their\nphase (essentially pure solids) because their concentration is constant and equal to\nthe ratio of their molar mass to their molar volume.\nThis expression rarely includes the components that would be present in very\nlarge amounts, as the variation in their concentration would be insignificant. This\n46 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nconcentration is in fact included in coefficient k, which becomes a “pseudo-\ncoefficient” rate:\n– if  = 1 then the reaction is known as monomolecular (for example A 2 does not\nexist);\n– if  = 2, then the reaction is known as bimolecular;\n– if  = 3, then the reaction is known as trimolecular.\nNOTE 3.2.– When a reactant is in gaseous form, its concentration will be replaced\nby its partial pressure. For ideal gases, it is expressed as follows:\nP A RT [3.5]\ni i\nTherefore, the rate coefficient defined from the partial pressures contains a term\nthat is inversely proportional to the temperature, whose influence is also negligible.\nNOTE 3.3.– The fundamental difference here appears between the reactivity of an\nelementary step and the specific speed of a non-elementary reaction for which there\nis no reason a priori that it obeys relation [3.4]. We will actually find numerous\ncases where this relation is not applicable.\n3.3.2. Rate factor of an elementary reaction\nIn an elementary reaction belonging to a given mechanism and involving\nreaction intermediates, the rate factor is the product of the rate coefficient plus the\nconcentrations of the principal components (reactants or products) involved in this\nelementary step raised to the power of partial orders.\nIn order to illustrate this definition, let us reconsider step [2.R1b] of the water\nsynthesis reaction. The reactivity of this step is:\nk [OH][H ] f [OH] with f k [H ]\n2 2 2 2 2 2\nwhere f is the rate factor of this step that involves the reactant H .\n2 2\nThe unit of a rate factor depends on the elementary reaction, like a rate\ncoefficient.\nNOTE 3.4.– The rate factors of a reaction carried out at constant concentrations\nare independent of time.\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 47\n3.4. Opposite elementary reactions\nIf an elementary reaction is possible in one direction then it is also theoretically\npossible in the opposite direction. The reverse reaction is often negligible, but in\nmany cases this is not true and we have to take into account the rates of both\nopposing reactions.\n3.4.1. Reactivity of two opposite elementary reactions\nIf the opposite reaction to [3.R1] occurs, it will be written as:\n  A 1 +2 A 2 ' 1 A' 1 +' 2 A' 2 [3.R2]\nwhere the reactivity of the reaction from left to right is:\n'k'[A ] 1[A ] 2 [3.6]\n1 2\nand the reactivity of the reaction from right to left:\n\"k\"[A'\n]'\n1[A'\n]'\n2 [3.7]\n1 2\nThe volumetric speed, which is the difference in the reactivities of both opposite\nreactions, is also called reactivity. Since it is obvious that the reactions take place in\nthe same area, the global reactivity is:\n'\"k'[A ] 1A ] 2 k\"[A' ]' 1[A' ]' 2 [3.8]\n1 2 1 2\nwhich can be written as:\n k\"[A' ]' 1[A' ]' 2 \nk'[A ] 1[A ] 2 1 1 2 \n1 2  k'[A\n1\n] 1[A\n2\n] 2  [3.9]\nWe will make the following assumption, which is generally implicitly accepted.\nASSUMPTION.– The rate coefficient of an elementary step is the same at\nequilibrium as in a non-equilibrium situation at the same temperature.\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the overall rate is zero. From this comes the\nrelation between the values of the concentrations taken at equilibrium:\n48 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n  [A' 1 ]' 1A' 2 ]' 2    k' K\n [A ] 1[A ] 2  k\" [3.10]\n 1 2 \nequil\nwhere K is the equilibrium constant at the temperature considered. Thus the\nreactivity becomes:\n [A' ]' 1[A' ]' 2 \nk'[A ] 1[A ] 2 1 1 2  [3.11]\n1 2\n K[A\n1\n] 1[A\n2\n] 2 \n3.4.2. Distance from equilibrium conditions\nAccording to thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy variation combined with\nthe reaction is:\n[A'\n]'\n1[A'\n]'\n2\n1 2\nGRTlnKRTln [3.12]\n[A ] 1[A ] 2\n1 2\nThe reactivity becomes:\n G\nk'[A 1 ] 1[A 2 ] 2   1exp RT   [3.13]\nThe quantity , defined by [3.14] represents the distance between the equilibrium\nconditions and the experimental conditions chosen to carry out reaction [3.R2]:\nG\n1exp [3.14]\nRT\nNOTE 3.5.– Expression [3.13], which involves the affinity  of the reaction (as\ndefined by De Donder) instead of Gibbs free energy, is often written as:\n \nk'[A 1 ] 1[A 2 ] 2 1exp  [3.15]\n RT\nNOTE 3.6.– When the experimental conditions are a long way from equilibrium\n(for example in the case of the continuing absence of products being formed) the\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 49\nexponential term is negligible compared to one and the reactivity takes the form in\n[3.4].\n3.4.3. Principle of partial equilibria\nDuring the study of the setting of reaction speeds with several steps, we will use\nthe following principle.\nPRINCIPLE.– When a system is in equilibrium all the elementary steps are at\nequilibrium.\nAs a direct consequence of this principle, when a system is a long way from\nequilibrium at least one of its steps is far from equilibrium.\n3.5. Influence of temperature on the reactivities of elementary steps\nThe rate coefficient k of an elementary reaction obeys Arrhenius’ law, which is\nwritten as:\nE\nk  Aexp a [3.16]\nRT\nwhere E is called the activation energy and is a positive quantity. A is called the\na\npre-exponential term (the term frequency factor, which is often encountered, should\nbe banned because the coefficient rate is expressed in s-1 only in first order\nreactions). In all strictness, it appears that A is not completely independent of\ntemperature (this is obvious if we replace the concentrations with the partial\npressures) but this variation is negligible compared to the exponential variation.\nMoreover, measurements are often performed in narrow temperature ranges in order\nto avoid reactions that are either too slow or too fast.\nArrhenius’ law is often encountered in its differential form:\ndlnk E\n a [3.17]\nd(1/T) R\nGiven its definition (see section 3.3.2), with constant concentrations it is obvious\nthat a rate obeys Arrhenius’ law with temperature.\n50 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n3.5.1. Influence of temperature near the equilibrium\nLet us reconsider equation [3.13]. At constant concentrations, only the rate\ncoefficient k' and Gibbs free energy vary with temperature by following Arrhenius’\nlaw for the former. The reactivity can therefore be written as:\n E\n A[A ] 1[A ] 2 exp a [3.18]\nΔG 1 2 RT\n1exp\nRT\nThus, near the equilibrium, it is no longer the reactivity but the ratio\n\nthat follows Arrhenius’ law.\nΔG\n1exp\nRT\n3.5.2. Activation energies of opposite elementary reactions and reaction enthalpy\nThe application of Arrhenius’ law to the rate coefficients, k' and k'', of two\nopposite elementary reactions leads to the definition of two activation energies, E'a and\nEa''. We will see in this chapter (see section 3.6) and Chapter 10 (section 10.2.7) on\nthe modeling of elementary steps that the physical meaning of activation energy is\nthe energy that the reaction system must exceed in order to react. This energy\nappears in Figure 3.1a, by plotting the energy of the system made up of the whole of\nthe atoms involved in the elementary reaction as a function of the reaction path\nwhich represents in fact the various relative positions of these atoms during the\nreaction. The system starts from an initial state in which the reactants of the step are\ninfinitely distant from each other (without interaction) and reaches a final state in\nwhich the products formed are infinitely distant from each other (without\ninteraction). Each intermediate abscissa is a relative position of the atoms included\nin all the reactants (and the products). We see that a change in the spatial distribution\nof atoms is followed by an energetic modification. The activation energy is thus the\nheight of the barrier appearing in the energy diagram.\nThe difference in energy between the initial and final states is the reaction\nenthalpy. If the reaction is endothermic (see Figure 3.1a), the final level is higher\nthan the initial level (H > 0). For an exothermic reaction (see Figure 3.1b), the final\nlevel is lower than the initial level (H < 0).\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 51\nFrom the diagram, we can deduce that the difference between the activation\nenergies of the direct reaction and the reverse reaction is equal to the enthalpy of the\nreaction:\nE' E\" H [3.19]\na a\nFigure 3.1. Activation energies of elementary reactions:\na) endothermic; and b) exothermic reactions\nThe immediate consequences of Figures 3.1a and 3.1b are:\n– an endothermic reaction has an activation energy that is at least equal to the\nenthalpy of the reaction;\n– an exothermic reaction can have a null activation energy;\n– a negative activation energy is inconceivable because it would mean that the\nstate corresponding to this energy would be more stable than the initial state, which\nwould therefore not exist.\nNOTE 3.7.– Everything we have just discussed concerning opposite reactions and\nthe energy diagram in Figure 3.1 applies to elementary reactions alone. Any use,\nespecially the interpretation of a so-called activation energy for non-elementary\nsteps, is the result of a fast extrapolation without any foundation.\n3.6. Modeling of a gas phase elementary step\nAfter decomposition into elementary steps reaction, it is necessary to understand\nhow this elementary step occurs. We will examine this issue in the case of a gas\n52 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nphase reaction that allows a more simple approach to the medium. More\ndevelopments will be studied in Chapters 10 and 11.\n3.6.1. Collision theory\nThe relationship between the molecularity of a reaction and the number of\nmolecules that must collide simultaneously during the elementary act is the basic\nidea of the modeling of elementary steps. Bimolecular reactions are by far the most\nfrequent. Sometimes the collision happens between identical species A and A , that\n1 2\nis to say two molecules of the same compound. Trimolecular reactions are extremely\nrare because they involve the simultaneous collision of three molecules, which is an\nexceptional phenomenon in a gaseous or liquid mixture with or without solid\nparticles. Reactions of an order equal or greater than four are excluded because the\nprobability of four or more molecules colliding in a single impact is null.\nThe first model is therefore devoted to bimolecular reactions and describes the\nreaction as being due to the mechanical impact between two molecules.\n3.6.1.1. Bimolecular reactions\nTrautz and Mac Lewis developed collision theory in 1917 independently of one\nanother and simultaneously.\nIn order that A molecules react with B molecules, the authors suggested it was\nessential that a molecule of A collides with a molecule of B. If this hypothesis is\ncorrect, then the speed of reaction will be proportional to the frequency of impacts.\nIn the case of gases, the kinetic theory of gases enables us to calculate the\nnumber of impacts per second (equation [3.20]) in a medium containing n\nA\nmolecules of A and n B molecules of B per cm3. Since the values of diameters A and\nb of the assumed spherical molecules and the molecular masses M A and M B are:\n2 8RT  1 1 \nZ 0 n A n B  A  B     [3.20]\n M A M B\nthe volumetric speed will be obtained by:\ndA Z\nv  0 mole.l1s1 [3.21]\ndt 1000N\na\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 53\nBy performing the numerical calculations, we realize that the reactions should\nalmost all be almost instantaneous. Moreover, expression [3.21] shows that these\nspeeds should vary as the square root of temperature.\nThe authors therefore suggested that the impacts might not all be effective and\nonly those involving enough energy are effective. However, Boltzmann has enabled\nus to establish that, among all the impacts, the number that involve energy greater\nthan value, E, is obtained by:\n E \nZ Z 0 exp  [3.22]\n RT \nhence the new expression of the speed:\nv dA  Z 0 exp  - E   k 0 ABexp  - E   [3.23]\ndt 1000N a  RT   RT \nThe energy, E, is not calculable but will be determined experimentally, because\nwe calculate:\nZ  E   E \nk  1,000N 0 AB exp  - RT   k 0 exp  - RT   [3.24]\na\nIt is now appropriate to ensure that the values of k that we have calculated are\n0\nconsistent with the experimental values. Table 3.1 provides some examples of\nvalues for the ratio f of the experimental value to the calculated value.\nk (experimental)\nReaction f  0\nk (computed)\n0\n2 IH → I + H 1.2\n2 2\n2NO 2 → 2NO + O 2 7.5 x 10-2\nCH CO C H + NaOH\n3 2 2 5\n→ CH CO Na + C H OH 2 x 10-5\n3 2 2 5\nC 2 H 4 + H 2 → C 2 H 6 5 x 10-2\nTable 3.1. Steric factor of a few elementary reactions\n54 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIt will be observed that the more the initial molecules deviate geometrically from\nthe sphere and the more complicated they are, the more the ratio f deviates from one.\nThis is the reason that coefficient f is designated a steric factor. In fact the IH\nmolecule is roughly a sphere with only a small excrescence due to the hydrogen\natom. In contrast, the ethyl acetate molecule is a practically linear chain.\nThe speed given by collision theory should therefore be corrected by a steric\nfactor. In other words, in order to be effective the impact should not only be enough\nenergetic but it must also occur in specific parts of the molecules.\nFinally, the big drawback is that this collision theory does not enable us to\ncalculate this steric factor or the energy, E. Thus, we are unable to definitively\ncalculate the elementary speed of the reactions a priori.\n3.6.2. Theory of activated complex\nFollowing collision theory, a model of the bimolecular reaction, called the theory\nof activated complexs or the theory of absolute speeds, was established in 1938 by\nEyring and Polanyi respectively.\nThis theory is based on the following reflection. Collision theory describes a\nphysical impact using classical mechanics. At the scale of the impact between two\nmolecules, classical mechanics fails and so this is replaced by quantum mechanics.\nIn the latter, the molecules are no longer rigid, which leads to the replacement of the\n“mechanical impact” by an “energetic impact”, which is an interaction between the\natoms of two molecules.\nTo introduce the elements of this theory, we will reason on the reaction between\nan atom X and a diatomic molecule YZ, such as:\nX + YZ → XY + Z [3.R3]\nThe theory calculates the potential energy of all three atoms by considering all\npossible configurations. We show that the minimum energy configurations are the\nthree collinear atoms. We therefore retain this disposition and each configuration is\nthen defined by the distances r , between atoms of X and Y, and r between atoms Y\n1 2\nand Z (see Figure 3.2).\nr r\n1 2\nX Z\nY\nFigure 3.2. Minimum energy configuration\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 55\nThis can be plotted in the space potential energy surfaces as a function of both\nconfiguration variables by using the calculated energies (see Figure 3.3).\nFigure 3.3. Equipotential surfaces and reaction path\nWe observe that these surfaces clearly show two valleys separated by pass,\ncalled the saddle point, and assume that the potential energy will always be minimal.\nWe deduce that during the reaction, the system follows these two valleys. Thus,\nstarting from point P (far X) we follow the first valley, then we pass through the\nsaddle point – which is characterized by its two distances – and we follow the\nsecond valley to reach point Q, where atom Z is separated from molecule XY.\nThe top of the saddle point is called the activated complex, which will be\ndenoted (XYZ)≠ (hence one of the names of the theory).\nThe path followed by the system is called the reaction path and is plotted on the\nabscissa in Figure 3.4. The potential energy is plotted on the ordinate.\nWe can then identify the energy of the saddle point that is represented by the\nheight of the top of the barrier. The calculation of activation energy is thus possible\nusing this theory.\nThe theory also enables us to establish an expression of speed from the crossing\nspeed at the top of the saddle point. Relation [3.31] is obtained where k is\nB\nBoltzmann’s constant (1.38 x 10-23 J.K-1) and h is Planck’s constant (6.62 x\n10-34 J.s):\n56 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nk T  E \nv B F.ABexp-  [3.25]\nh  RT \nFigure 3.4. Reaction path and activation energy\nThere is a factor F in this expression that is related to the various forms of\nmolecule energy (translation, rotation, vibration). This can be calculated through\nstatistical thermodynamics. Thus it is a priori possible to calculate the speed, hence\nthe second name of this theory. We will see how to calculate this speed in Chapters\n10 and 11.\nThe results are now in satisfactory agreement with the speeds measured.\n3.6.2.1. Monomolecular reactions\nMonomolecular reactions are mainly related to decomposition reactions such as:\nR → A + B [3.R4]\nIf this scheme was valid, there would theoretically be no need for collision\nbetween molecules because each molecule would spontaneously break down, which\nis not the case. Lindemann was the first to consider a bimolecular scheme, by\nintroducing an initial activation step of the molecule that consists of its collision\nwith another molecule:\nR + R → R*+ R [3.R4a]\nThen the activated molecule can choose between two behaviors:\n– simple deactivation by collision with another molecule:\nR* + R → R + R [3.R4b]\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 57\n– the possibility of decomposing:\nR* → A + B [3.R4c]\nThe speed is therefore proportional to the concentration of the activated\nmolecules:\nvk [R*] [3.26]\n3\nWith some approximations (see Chapter 10), Lindeman expressed the\nconcentration of the activated molecules as:\n2\nk R\nR*  1 [3.27]\n  k Rk\n2 3\nand by using [3.26], the speed becomes:\n2\nk k R\n1 3\nv [3.28]\nk Rk\n2 3\nwhere k , k and k are the rate coefficients of steps [3.R4a], [3.R4n] and [3.R4c],\n1 2 3\nrespectively.\nFrom relation [3.28], if we stay under high pressure from R the concentration of\nR becomes significant and we will obtain:\nk Rk [3.29]\n2 3\nIn other words, deactivation [3.R4b] is much more likely to occur than\ndecomposition [3.R4c], and then:\nk k R\n1 3\nv [3.30]\nk\n2\nThe reaction becomes of first order.\nIn the opposite case, decomposition is most likely under low pressures, and a\nsecond order expression should be obtained:\nvk\nR2\n[3.31]\n1\n58 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIndeed, for a monomolecular reaction, when we plot the speed with pressure\nafter an experiment we find a second order reaction under low pressures.\n3.7. A particular elementary step: diffusion\nAn extremely important phenomenon that occurs in kinetics is the transport of\nspecies from one point to another in the reactor. This is called diffusion. It is mainly\nseen during the study of heterogeneous reactions with several zones.\n3.7.1. The diffusion phenomenon\nDiffusion is a natural phenomenon of species motion that is due to the existence\nof a concentration gradient of the species. The motion occurs to counteract this\ngradient, i.e. to balance the concentrations and lead towards equilibrium. The motion\noccurs therefore in the direction of decreasing concentrations.\nDiffusion can be represented by a chemical equation like a chemical reaction\nwith unit stoichiometric coefficients, provided that the components located at the\nstarting point of diffusion are considered distinct from those at the end of the\ndiffusion path.\n3.7.2. Diffusion flux and Fick’s first law\nDiffusion is characterized by its flux, which gives the amount of a component\nthat passes through a unit area that is perpendicular to the diffusive direction per\ntime unit. It can be seen that diffusion has the same units as a surface-specific speed.\nFick postulated that for a component, A, this flux varies with the concentration\ngradient along a direction Ox according to a law, known as Fick’s first law, with the\nfollowing proportionality:\nA\nJ D [3.32]\nx\nIn the case of diffusion in all directions in space, this law can be generalized as:\n\nJ DgradA [3.33]\nIn these expressions, D is the diffusion coefficient and is independent of\nconcentrations.\nThe diffusion coefficient is expressed in m2s-1.\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 59\n3.7.2.1. Mass balance of the diffusing species and Fick’s second law\nThe concentration of the diffusing component is obtained at time t and a point in\nspace, by the solution of the second order differential equation with partial\nderivatives (the symbol [A] denotes the Laplacian of the concentration), see\nsection 6.3.4:\n[A]\nD[A] [3.34]\nt\nFor diffusion in a single direction Ox, the Laplacian expression leads to the\nfollowing relation:\n[A] \n2A\nD [3.35]\nt x2\n3.7.3. Diffusion flux in a steady state system\nA particularly simple solution to Fick’s second law is the set of steady state\nsolutions that assume the concentration is independent of time at each point.\nLet us then consider a plate of thickness X, whose other dimensions are very\nlarge compared to X in order to avoid any edge effect.\nA species diffuses through this plate under the action of a concentration gradient\nimposed by the values of concentrations at both ends that are held constant (see\nFigure 3.5).\nC\nC\n0\nC\n1 x\n0 X\nFigure 3.5. Diffusion through a plate of thickness x\n60 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nAccording to [3.35], we write the steady state in Fick’s law as:\n2\nd [A]\n 0 [3.36]\n2\ndx\nwith the conditions:\nif x = 0, [A]  [A]\n0\nfor t > 0 \nif x = X, [A]  [A]\nl\nhence the solution:\n[A ][A]\n[A]  l 0 x  [A] [3.37]\n0\nX\nThus the concentration gradient is constant and therefore also the flux. From\n[3.32], the flux’s value can be obtained:\n[A]  [A]\n0 l\nJ  D [3.38]\nX\n3.7.4. Reactivity and diffusion space function\nHere we should ask ourselves the following important question: is diffusion an\nelementary process?\nIf we examine the solution of the flux in equation [3.38], we find a specific law\nof speed that is proportional to the difference between concentrations at the start and\narrival of diffusion. This is consistent with an expected first order law of the\nchemical equation that we have written as:\nA  A\nstart arrival\nFurthermore, constant D obeys Arrhenius’ law like the rate coefficient of an\nelementary reaction.\nThe expression of the flux, however, reveals another term that called the\ndiffusion factor, G:\nl\nG 0 [3.39]\nX\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 61\nThis term does not appear in the specific speed equation of an elementary\nreaction. The answer to our question is therefore that diffusion is not an elementary\nstep.\nMore formally, we will introduce a reactivity and a space function that will give\nan elementary step character to the diffusion.\nFor steady state (or close to steady state) diffusion, we can provide an expression\nfor the absolute speed, which is the flow rate:\ndξ\n J S [3.40]\ndt\nThis flow, which acts as an areal speed, not only depends on intensive variables\nbut also contains factor G, which is a geometric term. In order to separate both\ncontributions, the flux can be written as:\nJ   G [3.41]\nThe function  is the diffusion reactivity. It has the same dimensions as surface\nreaction reactivity and is obtained through:\nD [A]  [A]\ni e\n  [3.42]\nl\n0\nWe arbitrarily choose l = 1 meter. Hence according to [3.40]:\n0\ndξ\n .G.S [3.43]\ndt\nThe following function E (l = 1 m) can therefore be called the diffusion space\n0\nfunction:\nGS S\nE  [3.44]\nA XA\n0 0\nNOTE 3.8.– If diffusion is far from equilibrium (which leads to a very high\nconcentration gradient for diffusion), the concentration at the end of the diffusion\npath is insignificant compared to that at the starting point. The reactivity can then be\nwritten as:\n62 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n D[A] [3.45]\ni\nReactivity  therefore only depends on intensive properties (temperature via D\nand concentrations at the ends of the diffusion zone).\nIt is expressed in m2 per mole, like the reactivity of a surface elementary\nreaction.\nFrom this and by using relation [3.3], it can be seen that the rate will always have\nthe following form – whether we are measuring an elementary chemical reaction or\ndiffusion (close to steady state):\nd\nr    E\ndt\n[3.46]\n3.7.5. Diffusion in solids\nDiffusion in solids is performed through the jump from a point defect (see\nAnnex 1) of one site to an equivalent site. Thus, we distinguish interstitial diffusion\nand vacancy diffusion. This jump is activated and the start and host sites are\nenergetically equivalent, as shown in Figure 3.6, which gives the energy of the\nsystem during a jump. The enthalpy of diffusion is therefore null, and the diffusion\ncoefficient obeys Arrhenius’ law with diffusion activation energy according to:\n E \nDD 0 exp  D  [3.47]\n RT \nThe magnitude of the diffusion coefficient is 10-12 m2s-1 and the magnitude of the\ndiffusion activation energy is ~100 KJ per mole.\nIf a is the distance between two host sites of the diffusing particles and k and h\nB\nare Boltzmann’s constant and Planck’s constant, respectively, it is shown that the\npre-exponential term of the diffusion coefficient obeys the relation:\na2k T  E \nD  B exp  D  [3.48]\n2h  RT \nThe laws established in solid medium also are valid in liquid medium for dilute\nsolutions and the magnitude of diffusion coefficients in liquids is\n10-9 m2s-1.\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 63\n\n\na\na\nx\nFigure 3.6. Diffusion jump in a solid\n3.7.6. Interdiffusion of gases\nThe interdiffusion coefficient of two gases 1 and 2, one inside the other, is\nobtained at temperature T and under total pressure P through the kinetic theory of\ngases by the following expression:\n3/2\n2P 2T  M M  c\nD    k B 1 2  0 [3.49]\n3σ σ  π  M M 3P\n1 2 1 2\nIn this expression:\n–  and  are the radii of gas molecules 1 and 2;\n1 2\n– M and M are their molar masses;\n1 2\n– k is Boltzmann’s constant;\nB\n– 0 is the mean free path under the unit pressure; and\n– c is the average speed of molecule movement.\nIt should be noted that diffusion in gases is not activated (there is no Arrhenius\nlaw) and it varies like T3/2 and is inversely proportional to pressure.\nThe magnitude of the interdiffusion coefficients of gases is 10-4 m2s-1.\n64 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n3.7.7. Diffusion of a gas in a cylindrical pore\nWe consider cylindrical pores with average radius, r. Depending on the gas\npressure domain and the pore’s radius, there are two types of regimes.\nIf the pressure is such that the pore radii are comparable or larger than the mean\nfree path of molecules, we say that we have a molecular regime. The diffusion\ncoefficient can then be calculated through Gilliland’s equation by using the gas\nmolecular mass M and its molar volume V :\nm\nMT3/2\nD  4.310-7 [3.50]\nPV2/3\nm\nIf the pressure is such that the pore radii are small compared to the mean free\npath of molecules (pore diameter <500 m under atmospheric pressure), we say that\nwe have a Knudsen regime. The diffusion coefficient can then be calculated by:\n3\n2r 8k T T\nD  B 97.107r m2s-1 [3.51]\n3 m M\n3.8. Gases adsorption onto solids\nEach time a gas is close to a solid, it binds to the surface of this solid: this is the\nadsorption phenomenon. More precisely, there are two types of adsorption:\n– Physical adsorption (or physisorption), which is especially visible at low\ntemperatures. Here the bond between the gas molecule and the solid surface has\nenergy of the same magnitude as the Van der Waals energy between molecules. This\nphysical adsorption is mainly used to determine the specific area of solids (solid area\nper gram of solid) and the porosity of the solid (shape and pores’ dimensions).\nPhysisorption is not a temperature-activated phenomenon.\n– Chemical adsorption (or chemisorption), which is especially sensitive to high\ntemperatures, in which the binding energies between the molecule (or atoms) and\nthe surface are of the same order of magnitude as the energy of chemical bonds.\nChemisorption is an important phenomenon in all reactions bringing together a gas\nand a solid (heterogeneous catalyzers, heterogeneous reactions, etc.). Chemisorption\nis a temperature-activated phenomenon.\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 65\n3.8.1. Chemisorption equilibrium: Langmuir model\nThe Langmuir model is the basic model for chemisorption equilibria. It relies on\na number of assumptions:\n– a single monolayer of gas is formed on the surface of the solid, hence we have\na saturation effect;\n– there is a chemical reaction between the gas and the sites located on the solid’s\nsurface. These sites are usually denoted by s but are identified in the case where the\nsolid is well known;\n– in order to account for the properties of the adsorption equilibrium, which\nshows that the amount adsorbed depends on both gas pressure and temperature, we\nintroduce the existence of a surface solution composed of unfilled sites s and sets\nG – s that identify the adsorbed molecule.\nIn these circumstances, we write the adsorption reaction as:\nGsGs [3.R5]\nGiven the assumption that species s and G – s are two components of the same\n“phase”, the application of the law of mass action to balance the previous reaction is\nwritten as follows:\nx\n K [3.52]\nP1x\nwhere x denotes the molar fraction of the G – s occupied sites.\nLet S be the total number of sites per unit area before adsorption and S the\n0\nnumber of sites unfilled at a given time. The amount of G – s will then be S – S and\n0\nthe fractional coverage will be defined by:\nS S\n  0 [3.53]\nS\n0\nThe molar fractions of the two components of the solution will be:\nS\n1x   1   and x  [3.54]\nS\n0\n66 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nAt the adsorption equilibrium, the fractional coverage is  and equilibrium\n\nequation [3.52] becomes:\n KP\n  K or   [3.55]\n\nP(1 ) 1KP\n\nThis equation is called the Langmuir isotherm.\nSince K is an equilibrium constant, it obeys van ’t Hoff’s law with temperature:\n\n\n H0\nK  K0exp   a  [3.56]\n  RT  \n \nwhere \n H0\nis the adsorption enthalpy which is negative since the adsorption is\na\nan exothermic phenomenon.\nGiven the variations of the equilibrium constant with temperature [3.61], the\nLangmuir equation is then written as:\n\n\n H0\nK0Pexp\n\n a \n  RT  \n \n  [3.57]\n \n\n H0\n1K0Pexp\n\n a \n  RT  \n \n3.8.2. Dissociative adsorption and the Langmuir model\nIt is difficult to imagine how some molecules of stable and saturated gases (H , O ,\n2 2\netc.) could form a chemical bond with a surface atom of the solid. To explain this\nassociation, we were led to admit that adsorption is most often accompanied with\ndissociation of the gas molecule. This has been confirmed through experiments by\ncomparing the adsorption of hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and ethane on\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 67\nnickel. We notice that the maximum amounts adsorbed are present in the following\nratios:\n     \nH N C H\n2 1 2 1 2 4 1\n= ; = and =\nCO 2 CO 2 CO 4\nWe deduce that if we assume that the carbon monoxide (which has the\npossibility of binding) binds to the nickel without decomposing, the dihydrogen and\ndinitrogen molecules will be dissociated into two atoms and the ethane molecules\ninto four clusters.\nThis dissociation has been verified by quantum computations of minimum\nenergy path, such as during the adsorption of dihydrogen.\nTherefore, let G be a gas of atomicity i that dissociates during adsorption\ni\naccording to:\nG  iG [3.R6]\ni\nThe equilibrium binding will be written as:\n1\nG sGs [3.R7]\ni\ni\nThe same reasoning as that of section 3.8.1 leads to:\n\n  K [3.58]\nP1/i(1   )\n\nThis is the new Langmuir equation with gas dissociation during the adsorption.\nIt is possible that the different fragments of gas AB do not bind to the same sites.\nSo, for instance, for a gas that dissociates into two entities, A and B, the equilibrium\nis written as follows:\nABs s As Bs [3.R8]\nA B A B\n68 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFrom the equilibrium we obtain:\n \nA B  K [3.59]\nP(1  )(1  )\nA B\nbut the fractional coverages of both entities are identical, hence:\n2\n\nA  K [3.60]\nP(1  )2\nA\nWe obtain a new Langmuir isotherm for the dissociative adsorption of a\nmolecule into two portions.\n3.8.3. Chemisorption of gas mixtures in the Langmuir model\nLet us consider the adsorption of a mixture of two gases, A and B, that takes\nplace on the same surface. Two cases can occur:\n– there are specific sites devoted to A and specific sites devoted to B, in which\ncase both adsorption reactions are independent and the isotherm equations are given\nby relations [3.55] or [3.58]; or\n– the adsorption sites of the solid are competitive with respect to A and B. In this\ncase, let A and B be the surface fractions at equilibrium covered by A and B,\nrespectively, and P and P be the partial pressures of both gases, respectively. The\nA B\nadsorption equilibria will be:\nAsAs [3.R9]\nand:\nBsBs [3.R10]\nThe molar fractions of the species will be:\nx   , x   and x  1     [3.61]\nAs A Bs B s A B\nKinetic Properties of Elementary Reactions 69\nThen by applying the law of mass action to both equilibria, the isotherms\nbecome:\n \nA  K and B  K [3.62]\nA B\nP (1     ) P (1     )\nA A B B A B\nThe fractional coverages can then be obtained:\nK P K P\n  A A and   B B [3.63]\nA B\n1  K P  K P 1  K P  K P\nA A B B A A B B\nIt is observed that the ratio of fractional coverage is proportional to the ratio of\npartial pressures:\n K P\nA  A. A [3.64]\n K P\nB B B\nThese results are easily generalized to the adsorption of more complex mixtures\nand it is shown that for gas A, belonging to a mixture, we have the following\nexpression:\nK P\n  A A [3.65]\nA\n1K P\nj j\nj\nThe sum is extended to all the gases present in the mixture whose adsorption\ntakes place on the same sites as gas A.\nNOTE 3.9.– If the gases are dissociated and the sites are competitive, by\nfollowing the same approach with dissociating molecules of the preceding section,\nthe partial pressures should be raised to the power of 1/i, i denoting the atomicity of\nj j\nthe gas j.\n70 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n3.8.4. Chemisorption kinetic in the Langmuir model\nChemisorption, which is a temperature-activated phenomenon, does not occur\ninstantaneously and features some speed, like a chemical reaction.\nWe will stick to the assumptions that led to the Langmuir isotherms and consider\nthe adsorption as an elementary step. We will consider the dissociative adsorption\nand distinguish two cases depending on whether the adsorption of both fragments of\nthe molecule takes place on similar or different sites.\n3.8.4.1. Fixation of both fragments on similar sites\nThe adsorption reaction can be written as:\nG 2s2Gs [3.R11]\n2\nThe speed per unit area will be expressed as:\n E   E \nv  ' P(1 )2exp a   ''  2exp d  [3.66]\n0  RT  0  RT \n   \nor:\n  2 \nv'P(1 )2 1  [3.67]\n KP(1)2\n \nand:\nd\n 2v [3.68]\ndt\nNOTE 3.10.– We have no right to choose fractional stoichiometric coefficients\nbecause the fixation reaction is considered equivalent to an elementary step.\n3.8.4.2.

Important figures in the kinetic properties of elementary reactions\nThe men whose work has led to our current understanding of the kinetic\nproperties of elementary reactions and who have been awarded the Nobel prize for\nchemistry are shown in Figure 3.7.\nJacobus van ’t Hoff Svante August Arrhenius\n(1852-1911) (1859-1927)\nNobel prize for chemistry in Nobel prize for chemistry\n1909 in 1903\nHenry Eyring Michael Polanyi\n(1901-1981) (1899-1976)\nFigure 3.7. Important chemists\n\nChapter 4\nKinetic Data Acquisition\nIn this chapter we will see some experimental techniques that are useful for\nmonitoring the evolution of a system that is undergoing a reaction. The aim is to\nacquire a file of triplets representing the extent, speed and time of a reaction.\nContinuous measurements are used as much as possible to avoid having to update a\nvariable several times. These data should be acquired for different values of the\nvariables, which are the concentrations of different species, the temperature, and\neventually the light intensity for photochemical reactions and the electric voltage for\nelectrochemical reactions.\nTo these macroscopic basic measures we add the acquisition methods of other\ndata that are related to modeling and we are able to provide additional information\nthat helps to establish a mechanism.\n4.1. Experimental kinetic data of a reaction\nThe experiment aims to derive a number of kinetic properties, such as the extent,\nfractional extent and speed (speed, specific speed or rate), which are not directly\nmeasurable. The results are grouped into two families:\n– integral curves, which represent the extent or fractional extent in function of\ntime or concentrations of components versus time in a closed environment;\n– derivative curves, which represent a speed (absolute, volumetric or rate) as a\nfunction of time, fractional extent or concentrations of different species.\n74 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n4.2. Generalities on measuring methods\nA chemical transformation depends on temperature, concentrations and time.\nThe measurements are therefore generally carried out at a constant temperature and\nat different times. There is no method by which to directly measure the kinetic\nproperties of a reaction. The measurement methods are most often performed by the\nmeasurement of quantities that are related to the extent or fractional extent versus\ntime, and we thus obtain the integral curves. The derivation of these data with\nrespect to time leads to the rate of transformation at any time and then to the\ndifferent derivative curves.\nKinetics measurements are generally carried out in difficult conditions because\nthe experimenter has to meet extremely strict conditions:\n– first, reactions take place over a large variety of time scales, ranging from\nsubstantially geological durations to durations of less than a nanosecond. We need\nsome methods to perform measurements in the nano scale as well as some methods\nto perform measurements in the thousands-of-years scale;\n– second, many reactions involve complex mixtures of species that might have\nvery different concentrations and we want to be able to measure the individual\nconcentrations and the variations of all these species;\n– third, we want to carry out all these measurements without interfering with the\nreaction, hence the advantage of non-destructive physical measurements;\n– fourth, we would ideally like to automate and computerize the measurement\nand new data acquisition techniques to enable modern treatment of the data.\nWe will distinguish two categories of methods: chemical methods and physical\nmethods.\n4.3. Chemical methods\nChemical methods are applicable to homogeneous reactions in gas or liquid\nphase. They consist of measuring a concentration at every known time interval. In\ngeneral, these methods are discontinuous. The reaction mixture is placed in sealed\nvials that are kept at desired temperature by immersion in a thermostated bath. The\nvials are collected at known intervals. The reaction is stopped either through quench\n– by rapidly placing the vial in a cold bath – or through a chemical method – by\nemptying the vial into a suitable reagent, which leads to a fast reaction with one of\nthe reactants. The difficulty is to be able to stop the reaction in order to analyze the\nvial. This approach applies to reactions that are not too fast because the time spent\nsetting the temperature should be negligible, which is easier for gases.\nKinetic Data Acquisition 75\nFor example, Bodenstein studied hydrogen iodide decomposition according to:\n2IH = I + H [4.R1]\n2 2\nby placing several sealed vials that contained acid and are analyzed at different time\nintervals in the same chamber and by breaking them in a solution that contains\nexcess sodium hydroxide with respect to the initial amount of acid. The iodine was\nthen analysed through iodometry; while the sodium hydroxide remained through\nacidimetry; and the hydrogen volume was formed. These three results enable\noverlapping (see section 7.1.5.1). The fractional extent is obtained by using the\nfollowing equations:\nI  H  IH IH\n 2  2 = 0 [4.1]\nIH IH 2IH\n0 0 0\n4.4. Physical methods\nHere, analyses are replaced by the continuous acquisition of a property provided\nby the method. We then need to know how to relate this quantity to the fractional\nextent or the rate of the reaction. There are two categories of methods:\n– those that require the separation of a component; and\n– those that apply directly to the reaction mixture.\n4.4.1. Methods without separation of components\n4.4.1.1. Manometric method\nThis method is used in the gas phase when there is a change in the number of\nmoles of gas due to the reaction. The total pressure is measured in a closed gas\nchamber.\nLet us reconsider the reaction described by chemical equation [1.R3].\nWe start from a stoichiometric mixture of reactants, which means we have\n A \nA  moles of component A and i 1 0 moles of each of the other reagents i,\n1 0 1 \n1\nwhich leads to pressure P . It can be proven that if P is the pressure at time t and P\n0 ∞\nthe pressure reached when the reaction is complete, we have:\n76 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nPP\n 0 [4.2]\nP P\n 0\nThis method applies to gas-phase reactions or to heterogeneous reactions that\nlead to a change in gas amount, such as the decomposition of a carbonate.\n4.4.1.2. Variations in density and viscosity\nThis method simultaneously uses the properties of viscosity and density. In two\nidentical cells (see Figure 4.1), we introduce the reaction mixture in one side and a\npure gas, such as nitrogen in the other. Let us assume that, under the same pressure,\nthe mixture’s viscosity is lower than nitrogen’s viscosity and that its density is the\nhighest. Thus the mixture flows faster in its capillary tube (lower viscosity) than\nnitrogen. As the mixture has the highest density, it crosses the hole more slowly\nwhen it reaches C, so there is an accumulation of the mixture in part BC and the\npressure here is higher than in the cell (2).\nThis pressure will vary with the composition of the mixture, which means it\nvaries with the fractional extent of the reaction. This method only applies to gases\nand requires prior calibration.\nFigure 4.1. Device to follow the reaction with viscosity and density measurements\nKinetic Data Acquisition 77\n4.4.1.3. Thermal conductivity variations\nThermal conductivity depends on the gas studied. Furthermore, in the case of a\nmixture, it characterizes the concentrations when blending is known. A device called\na katharometer is used and consists of two identical cells. The reaction mixture\npasses through one cell and the reactants pass through the other (at constant speeds,\nsee Figure 4.2).\nLet us recall that the heat conduction between two points is expressed in joules\nper second per meter and per degree, and that it is proportional to the temperature\ndifference between two points.\nFigure 4.2. Katharometer\nIf an electric current passes through the resistors of each cell, the internal\ntemperature of each cell will rise until it reaches the limit value corresponding to\nthermal equilibrium (the energy absorbed by the gas is equal to that released through\nthe resistance).\nThere is a set composition of the reaction mixture flowing through the right cell\nfor each limit temperature, and therefore a corresponding resistor value. Hence, if a\ngas with a constant volume passes through the left-hand cell there will be some\ndeviation in the galvanometer.\nThe method is restricted to homogeneous reactions in gas phase and requires a\nprior calibration.\n78 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n4.4.1.4. Spectrographic methods\nLet I and I be the intensities of incident beams that pass through the gas mixture\n0\nor absorbing liquid within the wavelength range of the incident light. For a\ncomponent A in the mixture at concentration [A], the Beer–Lambert law is written as\nfollows:\nI\nln KlA [4.3]\nI\n0\nIn the case where the spectra of different substances that are present in the\nmixture overlap, it will be necessary to use a monochromatic light corresponding to\nan absorption peak for the species to be assayed.\nThe colorimetry in the visible range and the photometry in the infrared and\nultraviolet ranges constitute the techniques that are used. If there is no interference\nbetween components and the mixture absorbs in the infrared range, the total infrared\nanalyzer will be used (see Figure 4.3).\nFigure 4.3. Cell for total infrared measurement\nThe rise in temperature of a gas in an enclosure subjected to an infra-red\nradiation is all stronger as the gas absorbs more the radiation, the rise in pressure\nwill thus be greater. The variation in pressure causes the deformation of a capacitor\nplate, which modifies its capacity according to the composition of the mixture.\n4.4.1.5. The measurement of masses in condensed phases\nThe mass of a solid sample heated to a chosen temperature in a specific gaseous\natmosphere is continuously measured via an electronic gravimetric device. This\nmethod is suitable for all heterogeneous reactions involving a solid and producing a\nvariation in the number of gaseous moles.\nKinetic Data Acquisition 79\nLet us assume that the reaction is written as follows:\nA (solid) + 1 G 1 (gas) = B B (solid) + 2 G 2 (gas) [4.R2]\nIt is easy to show that the fractional extent of the reaction is obtained through:\nmm\nM 0 [4.4]\nA\nm  M  M \n0 1 1 2 2\nIn this expression M , M and M are the molar masses of both gases and solid\n1 2 A\nA, respectively.\n4.4.1.6. Measurement of a heat flux\nA Calvet-type microcalorimeter (see Figure 4.4) enables us to measure the heat\nflux that is released or absorbed by the sample that is in the cell. It can be easily\nproven that the reaction speed is related to the heat flux using the following\nequation:\ndQ d\nH [4.5]\ndt dt\nIn this equation, H is the enthalpy associated with the reaction. This technique\ncan be used for liquid-phase reactions and heterogeneous reactions involving solids\nor a liquid in addition to gas.\nFigure 4.4. A Calvet-type microcalorimeter\n80 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n4.4.1.7. Dilatometric method\nThis method is mostly used in a liquid medium through a rod dilatometer\nthermostated to 1/1,000ºC. It relies on the differences in molar volume of different\ncomponents (the solution is assumed to be ideal). During the reaction, the difference\nin the volume of a liquid between times 0 and t is related to the various amounts of\nspecies in the medium. If v0 denotes the molar volume of component k, this\nk\nrelationship is expressed as follows:\nV V v0A v0A  [4.6]\n0 k k k k 0\nk k\nhence the relationship between the variation in volume and the reaction speed:\ndV\n\nd\nv0  [4.7]\nk k\ndt dt\nk\nThe volumetric speed is obtained through:\n1 dV\nv [4.8]\nVv0  dt\nk k\nk\n4.4.1.8. Polarimetry\nThis method can be used for homogeneous reactions in liquid medium provided\nthat at least one of the principal components of the reaction is optically active.\nAccordingly, the reaction is performed in a thermostated polarimeter.\nBiot’s law determines the angle  of rotation of the polarization plane of light\nafter the liquid containing the optically active component, which has the\nconcentration [A], travels a given length l. This law is almost additive for a mixture\ni\nof optically active substances:\nlk A  [4.9]\nj  j\nj\nwhere k is the specific optical rotation of the component A and is a feature of the\nj j\nsubstance. Each of the concentrations involved is related to the initial conditions and\nthe fractional extent through equation [1.30], which can be calculated if the volume\nof the reaction zone is known.\nKinetic Data Acquisition 81\n4.4.1.9. Refractometry\nMacroscopic property P is called molecular polarization, which is constant for\nm\na pure compound. It is related to the refractive index n , the molar mass M and the\nR\ndensity  of this compound through the equation:\nn2 1 M\nR P [4.10]\nn2 2  m\nR\nFor a mixture of density d, which is composed of substances of M , M , etc.\n1 2\nmolar masses, we assume, with a good approximation, that the molecular\npolarizations are additive. So, if x , x etc. are the mole fractions in the mixture:\n1 2\nn2 1 x M x M ...\nR 1 1 2 2 Const [4.11]\nn2 2 d\nR\na molar fraction is defined as:\nA  A \nk k\nx   [4.12]\nk A  A \nk k\nk k\nIf a reaction is taking place within the mixture, the molar fractions will vary and\ntherefore the refractive index will vary. It is possible to obtain the fractional extent\nbecause all of the molar fractions are related to the concentrations by means of the\nabove equation and thus to fractional extent.\nIn order to obtain the refractive index, a beam is pointed onto the mixture under\ngrazing incidence, the maximum refraction angle  is measured and the index is\ndeduced as follows:\nn 1/sin [4.13]\nR\nThe method is used for homogeneous reactions in liquid medium.\nA variant of this method involves measuring the permittivity  of the mixture,\nwhich is linked to the refractive index through the following equation:\nn2 [4.14]\nR\n82 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n4.4.1.10. Absorption spectroscopy\nThe liquid reaction medium is placed in the path of a beam of suitable radiation.\nThe transmittance obtained enables us to directly obtain the concentration of the\ncomponent that is absorbed by this wavelength, through the application of Beer–\nLambert’s law. This method is particularly suitable for reactions in liquid medium.\nThe wavelength chosen for a component does not interfere with the absorption of\nother components.\n. . .\nFigure 4.5. Absorption spectrum during toluene chlorination\nFigure 4.5 shows the spectrum obtained at two different times during the\ncatalytic chlorination of toluene. The three chosen wavelengths enable us to assay\neach of the compounds formed and the initial toluene, which is thus subjected to two\nparallel reactions in homogeneous phase.\n4.4.1.11. Electrical conductivity\nIn a sufficiently dilute solution of strong electrolytes, we assume that the\nequivalent conductivities  (ratio of the conductivity to the concentration) remain\napproximately constant. The participation of each electrolyte in the total\nconductivity is proportional to its concentration.\nIn order to use this method, at least one of the principal components must be an\nelectrolyte. If it is a strong electrolyte, calculation of the extent of the reaction is\ngreatly simplified. If the solutions are not diluted enough or if weak electrolytes are\ninvolved, a prior calibration of the solutions should be performed using mixtures of\nelectrolytes that are present.\n4.4.1.12. Potentiometry\nThe potential of an electrode immersed in a solution of its ions (electrode of the\nfirst type) is linked to the concentration of the corresponding ions through Nernst law:\nRT\n 0  lnMn [4.15]\nnF  \nKinetic Data Acquisition 83\nFor instance, we can monitor the evolution of a reaction involving acids or bases\nby using a pH indicator electrode.\nThe potential measurement is made by assigning the measuring electrode to a\nreference electrode and evaluating the e.m.f. of the resulting battery.\nThis method is especially useful in dilute liquid solutions, which is the domain of\nvalidity Nernst Law in concentrations.\n4.4.1.13. Polarography\nA polarograph automatically records the intensity of the electrolytic current as a\nfunction of the potential difference that has been determined.\nEach substance likely to be reduced by electrolysis or to deposit a metal leads to\na wave that has a half-wave potential, which characterizes the electrolysis\nconsidered independent of concentrations.\nThe solution is subjected to several assays (the electrolyzed amount is negligible)\nand the evolution can be monitored over time. This is done by setting a voltage E so\nthat the level of the wave is reached and measuring the amplitude of the current of\nlevel (h) as a function of time.\nThe electrolytic potential should be within the 0.4 V (for a mercury electrode) to\n-1.8 V range. In order to separate two components (see Figure 4.6), their half-wave\npotentials should be distant from 0.1 V.\nThis method is especially useful with species that are present at low\nconcentrations.\nFigure 4.6. Example of polarogram separating two species\n84 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n4.4.2. Physical methods with separation of components\nIn these methods one or more components of the reaction are separately assayed.\n4.4.2.1. Chromatographic method\nThe reaction mixture studied passes through a column containing substance of a\nsuitable steady state phase. The phenomena of adsorption, desorption or dissolution\nat the column exit delay the various components of the mixture, which are thus\nseparated. It is then, therefore, possible to assay these components.\nThis method is used for gases (gas-phase chromatography), liquids (liquid-phase\nchromatography) and eventually for ions (ion chromatography).\n4.4.2.2. Mass spectroscopy\nThe mass spectrometer is a detection and assay device for chemical entities in\ngas phase. The reactor, which is supplied with reagents, operates in continuous flow.\nA tiny hole (0.4 mm2) is pricked in the reactor, which enables leakage of the\nreaction mixture. A second hole of the same size is located opposite the former: the\nleakage becomes a molecular beam that passes through the elements of a quadrupole\nsystem (Figure 4.7). The latter serves as mass selector. Finally the ion detector enables\nus to measure the ions created from the molecules of the components of the reaction\nby the ionization source. The entities are often numerous and the selection is difficult,\nhowever, hence the use of the mass spectrometer after a gas-phase chromatograph that\nhas already been performed to separate the components.\nFigure 4.7. Circuit diagram of a device of measuring\nreaction kinetics through mass spectrometry\nKinetic Data Acquisition 85\n4.4.3. Study of fast reactions\nWe must consider how the mixture of reactants and the start of the reaction will\nbe performed regardless of the method chosen to obtain a specific property. This\nraises a real problem, mainly for fast reactions. In fact, it is well understood that a\nblending time of 1 second is not acceptable if the reaction lasts 100 ms. The method\nmust be fast in terms of the reaction timescale, which is difficult in conventional\nreactors. Thus novel methods suited to fast reactions have been developed and we\nwill now consider three of them.\n4.4.3.1. Continuous flow method\nThe introduction of continuous flow techniques enables us to measure the speeds\nof reactions that last 1 second or less. The idea is to place the reactants in a micro-\nmixer that features a graduated capillary tube. The flow rate is kept constant by an\naspirating pump.\nWhen the steady state mode is established, a reactant or a product is assayed,\ngenerally through spectroscopy at various distances from the mixer along the\ncapillary. Under constant flow rate, each distance corresponds to a reaction time and\nthe experimenter can measure these. This method also enables us to measure\nextremely fast reactions.\nFigure 4.8. Principle of the measurement system in continuous flow\nThe analysis of the mixture can be completed in 1 ms, as with a flow rate of\n10 m/s, a length of 1 cm corresponds to 1 ms of reaction.\nThis method can be used in gas or liquid phase.\n4.4.3.2. Flash photolysis\nThe idea of this method is to utilize a flash of intense and fast light, usually from\na laser, in order to generate reactive species, especially atoms and free radicals. The\n86 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nreaction of these species with other reactants present in the system is usually\nmonitored through spectrometry. The problem of reactants blending is resolved by\nthe fact that radicals are generated in situ.\n4.4.3.3. Relaxation methods\nRelaxation methods are a convenient way of addressing the problem of blending\ntime. We start from a system already in thermodynamic equilibrium and we disturb\nthis equilibrium through a small and very fast variation in one of the equilibrium\nvariables (temperature, pressure and eventually electric field for the ionic reactions).\nThen we measure the variations of one species concentration, usually through rapid\nspectroscopy, during the system’s return to equilibrium. For instance, a system can\nbe heated very rapidly (<30 ns) by using a laser pulse.\nThe relaxation time represents the time it takes the disturbance’s amplitude to\ndecrease by a factor of 1/e.\nLet us consider the example of the following reaction:\nA + B = C + D [4.R3]\nand assume that the speed from left to right is:\ndA\n k'AB [4.16]\ndt\nand from right to left is:\ndA\nk''CD [4.17]\ndt\nLet a, b, c and d be the concentrations of the four species in equilibrium. After\nthe disturbance, at a time t, let us assume that the concentration of a is: a – x.\nThe speed at that time will be written as follows:\ndx\n k'(ax)(bx)k\"(cx)(dx) [4.18]\ndt\nKinetic Data Acquisition 87\nBy ignoring the term in x2 (small disturbance) and noting that according to the\nlaw of mass action we have the following relation:\nk'abk\"cd [4.19]\nwe get:\ndx\n x[k'(ab)k\"(cd)] [4.20]\ndt\nWith an initial disturbance x and through integration we obtain:\n0\n t \nxx 0 expk'(ab)k\"(cd) tx 0 exp  [4.21]\n \nthus, we deduce that the relaxation time will be:\n1\nk'(ab)k\"(cd) [4.22]\n\nwhere is determined for different sets of concentrations a, b, c and d, and the graph\nof 1/ is plotted as a function of (a + b). We thus obtain a straight line of slope k,\nwhose intercept enables us to calculate k''.\nFor more complex reactions, the reasoning is obviously more complicated, but\ncomputer analysis of data helps provide information as well as in the case of several\nsuccessive reactions.\nOther methods, that are more specific to a given reaction, can also be used as\nlong they provide the expected information on the evolution of the reaction.\n4.5. Researching the influence of various variables\nThe form of speed law can be very diverse according to the various variables:\nconcentrations, temperature and extent. A number of complementary experiments\nwill bring us information on these forms of law. These complementary experiments\nare carried out in accordance with certain methodologies.\n88 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nHaving identified the reactions that occur with their stoichiometric coefficients,\nit is now important to see whether we can obtain the kinetic properties, which are the\nextent (or fractional extent) and speed (or reactivity) from experimental quantities\n(measured speed and extent). For this research it is essential to perform the pseudo-\nsteady state test (see section 7.1.5). In fact, this test only enables us to characterize\nthe reaction by a single definition of speed regardless of the component analyzed or\nthe property selected to monitor the evolution of the system. If this test is not\nsatisfied, we should be aware that each property corresponds to a specific extent that\nis proper to it or to a combination of several extents.\n4.5.1. Ostwald’s isolation method\nThis method is intended, in closed systems, to “isolate” the variations in the\namount of one component of the reaction. So, the reaction is monitored within a\nmixture in which all the components, except one, are in very large excess compared\nto the component being studied. Thus, the amounts (and eventually the\nconcentrations) of all these excess components will be considered to be virtually\nconstant during the measurement time and therefore their influence will be constant.\nOnly the amount of the isolated component will be a function of the fractional\nextent.\nWe should not forget to consider the products formed from among the\ncomponents.\nThis method can be varied so that all of the components in the reaction are\navailable in constant amounts. This is equivalent to performing the reaction in an\nextremely narrow range of fractional extent.\n4.5.2. Variables separation\nIn order to carry out modeling, it is useful to know whether the speed variables, a\npriori temperature, concentration or partial pressure and the fractional extent are\nseparate variables in the expression of speed. In other words, whether the speed can\nbe written as a product of several functions, each function having a single variable,\nwhich means that the speed would be written:\nr  f(A ,...,A ,T,)g (A )....g (A ).h(T).m() [4.23]\n1 i 1 1 i i\nThis method relies on the theorem of separate variables, which is stated as\nfollows.\nKinetic Data Acquisition 89\nIf two curves representing a function y of one variable x, obtained for two values\nof parameter a, are deduced from one another through an orthogonal affinity of axis\nOx, of direction Oy and of ratio k, then in the function’s expression, variable x is\nseparated. This means that we can write the following logical expression: if k is\nindependent of x and:\ny f(a ,x)\n1  1 k [4.24]\ny f(a ,x)\n2 2\nthen:\ny f(a,x) g(a).h(x) [4.25]\nand vice versa. We will describe and use this method in Chapter 9 section 9.6.1.3.\nThe influence of concentrations and temperature are also important parts of the\nexperimental work. We will see later (sections 8.7.1 and 9.7.2) how to manage such\nstudies.\n\nChapter 5\nExperimental Laws and Calculation of Kinetic\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems\nReaction models that specify the elementary steps and their location should\nenable us to obtain the experimental kinetic laws, such as fractional extent as a\nfunction of time; and speed as a function of the physical variables such as pressure,\ntemperature and introduced concentrations of reactants and products. In the first step\nwe consider the cases of homogeneous reactions where all the components belong to\nthe same phase. It is known that such reactions occur in a single reaction zone,\nwhich is within the volume of the mixture. All the intermediate steps will then take\nplace in the single reaction zone and will therefore have the same space function,\nwhich is the volume reduced to a mole of a reactant:\nE = V/n [5.1]\n0\n5.1. Experimental laws in homogeneous kinetics\nThe experimental speed is usually obtained for closed systems as a function of\nthe concentrations and temperature. Curiously, however, speeds as a function of\ntime or fractional extent are never obtained. At most, the intervention of time\nappears in some reactions through a notion of current order that differs from an\ninitial order. Moreover, it is not specified whether the speeds are compared at\nconstant time or fractional extent.\nFor closed systems, the integral laws appear mostly as a concentration depending\non time and the initial concentrations.\n92 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe influence of temperature mostly appears as Arrhenius’ law upon a\n“constant” of speed or sometimes directly upon the speed (certainly at given\nconcentrations).\n5.1.1. Influence of concentrations\nFor speed–concentration relationships, four cases can be distinguished, that will\nbe discussed in sections 5.1.1.1 to 5.1.1.4.\n5.1.1.1. The reaction admits an order with partial orders equal to a series of\nstoichiometric coefficients\nIf a reaction admits an order, with partial orders equal to a series of\nstoichiometric coefficients, it is said that such a reaction obeys van ’t Hoff’s\nprinciple. At first this author believed there to be a universal law similar to that of\nmass action for chemical equilibria.\nFor a reaction written as follows:\n1 A 1 +… + i A i +… =’ 1 A’ 1 +… +’ j A j +… [5.R1]\nthe volumetric speed is obtained from van ’t Hoff’s law as follows:\ndA\n i kA β 1...Aβ i [5.2]\n1 i\ndt\nfor example, substitution reactions of second order (SN2 reactions), such as:\nPh-CH Cl + HCH OH → Ph-CH -OCH +HCl [5.R2]\n2 2 2 3\nwhose speed is:\ndPh -CHCl\n  kPh -CH 2 ClHCH 2 OH [5.3]\ndt\nor the reactions:\nd[N O ]\nN 2 O 5 = 2NO 2 + 1/2O 2  2 5  k[N 2 O 5 ] [5.R3]\ndt\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 93\nd[NO]\n2NO + O 2 = 2NO 2   k[NO]2O 2  [5.R4]\ndt\nIt should be noted that everything goes as if the reaction was elementary, which\nis usually the case for reaction [5.R2] but not for the other examples.\n5.1.1.2. The reaction admits an order, but the partial orders do not correspond to\nany series of stoichiometric coefficients\nThe reduction reaction of hydrogen peroxide by bromides:\nH O + 2HBr = Br + H O [5.R5]\n2 2 2 2\nturns and leads to the following speed law:\nd[Br ]\n2  k[H 2 O 2 ] 3HBr [5.4]\ndt\nwhich is of the third order with respect to hydrogen peroxide and first order with\nrespect to hydrogen bromide. Thus the law admits partial orders but they do not\ncorrespond to any series of stoichiometric coefficients.\n5.1.1.3. The reaction follows different laws at the initial and current time\nFormaldehyde decomposition according to:\nCH CHO = CH + CO [5.R6]\n3 4\nhas a speed equation that is written at the initial time (in the absence of products\nformed) as:\nd[CO]\n3/2\n k[CH 3 CHO] [5.5]\ndt\nand at current time (in the presence products formed) as:\n2\nd[CO] k[CH CHO]\n3\n [5.6]\ndt [CH CHO]\n3 0\nWe see that the law differs depending on the time of measurement. It admits an\norder (that does not correspond to a series of integer stoichiometric coefficients) at\nthe initial time, but not during the measurement.\n94 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nNote that [5.6] can be written:\nd[CO]\n k[CH CHO]3/2(1)1/2\n3\ndt\nwhich has the same form as [5.8] with =0.\n5.1.1.4. The reaction admits no order\nThe following hydrogen bromide synthesis reaction:\nH + Br = 2HBr\n2 2\nadmits no order. The concentrations law is written as follows:\nH Br 1/2\n2 2\nv  HBr [5.8]\n1 k\n2 Br \n2\nwhere k and k are two constants depending on temperature.\n1 2\nThe decomposition reaction of N O into nitrogen and oxygen gives a speed\n2\nexpression that admits no order because it is written as follows:\ndO  k 1 N 2 O\n\nk 2 N 2 Ok\n3\n2\n [5.9]\ndt k k\n2 3\n5.1.2. Influence of temperature\nThe reaction speeds frequently obey Arrhenius’ law, which does not mean that\nthe temperature coefficient defined in section 4.5.4.1 is an activation energy. In\naddition to this, we note that several nitric monoxide reactions have a negative\ntemperature coefficient. Should we therefore conclude that the latter leads to a\nnegative activation energy?\nIn other cases it is necessary to introduce two temperature coefficients depending\non the field in order to account for the influence of temperature. This is the case, for\nexample, in the reduction of nitrogen dioxide by carbon monoxide. Figure 5.1 shows\nthe shape of the curve in “Arrhenius” coordinates.\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 95\nNOTE 5.1.– Some authors interpret the change in slope of the preceding curve as\na change in mechanism, thus assigning a mechanism to an activation energy and\nvice versa. We will show later that this is completely wrong. Changes in mechanism\nare rare and the change in slope is easily explained by changes in first species mode\n(section 7.4.5), which means it is related to the fact that the calculation of speed\nutilizes approximation methods. In fact, the definition of two slopes from this type\nof curve is usually also an approximation (see Figure 5.1).\nl nln v v\n1/T\nFigure 5.1. Arrhenius “two-slope” curve\nNOTE 5.2.– It should be noted that for all reactions that admit an order,\nconcentrations variables that are separate from each other and from temperature in\nthe volumetric expression of speed, which means that the speed obeys an expression\nwritten as follows:\nv f(T).g A .g A ... [5.10]\n1 1 2 2\n5.2. Relationship between the speed of a reaction and the speeds of its\nelementary steps\nIf we consider a component of reaction A, its balance can be written as [1.22] by\ntaking into account [3.3] and extending the sum to all the steps of the mechanism\nthat involve component A, either as a reactant or as a product, with the\nstoichiometric coefficient A, :\n96 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\ndA\n v a ν A  ν A, φ ρ E ρ n 0 [5.11]\ndt\n\nIn the case of a homogeneous reaction, since all the steps take place in the same\nzone – they have the same space function – a simple relationship between the\nvolumetric speed and the reactivities of elementary steps is obtained by taking into\naccount [1.12]:\n1 dA 1\n[5.12]\n v  ν φ\nA,ρ ρ\nVν A dt ν A ρ\nIf the volume is constant throughout the reaction, we deduce that:\ndA\n ν A,ρ φ ρ [5.13]\ndt\nρ\nIt should be noted that if we change the component by substituting A with B, the\nequivalent of the previous relationship would not necessarily involve the same steps\nin the sum, nor the same coefficients. This would mean that there are several\nvolumetric speeds depending on the component chosen to define it, which\ncontradicts relation [1.3]. We will return to this problem in Chapters 6 and 7.\n5.3. Mathematical formulation of speed from a mechanism and experimental\nconditions\n5.3.1. Example of resolution of a mechanism in a closed system\nWe will consider the following reaction, which will be called our reference\nreaction because it will help us to illustrate several of our statements:\nA = B [5.R7]\nIts mechanism involves an intermediate component X, two successive steps and\ntheir opposites, both steps taking place in the same volume zone (homogeneous\nreaction):\nAX [5.R7a]\nXB [5.R7b]\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 97\nLet us assume that this reaction is performed in a closed system with respect to\nall of the components. We will reason about the speed per volume unit and by\napplying [5.13] to the concentrations of the three components A, X and B, we can\nwrite:\ndAA A X\n0 k' k\" [5.14]\ndt\n1A 1A\n0 0\ndXA A X B\n0 k' (k\" k' ) k'' [5.15]\ndt 1A 1 2 A 2A\n0 0 0\ndBA X B\n0 k' k\" [5.16]\ndt\n2A 2A\n0 0\nWe also have the total concentration balance, which enables us to write:\nAXB\n1 [5.17]\nA\n0\nFigure 5.2. Evolution of concentrations of the various components of the\nreaction system composed of steps [5.R7a] and [5.R7b] over time\nOur three unknowns are the three relative concentrations. Thus we only need\nthree of the four equations in order to solve the system, or at best two differential\nequations chosen from [5.14], [5.15] and [5.16] and the algebraic equation [5.17].\nFigure 5.2 shows the variations of the three relative concentrations versus time for a\nseries of values of the rate factors k' and k'' for the opposite reactions of step\n1 1\n[5.R7a], and k' and k'' for both opposite steps of reaction [5.R7b]. The system\n2 2\ncannot be resolved algebraically, hence the use of numerical methods. We have used\n98 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nthe Runge–Kutta method with four factors in order to obtain the curves in Figure\n5.2. It can be seen that the concentration of A decreases with time while that of B\nincreases. The concentration of intermediate X, which starts from zero and reaches\nzero at the end of the reaction, passes through a maximum value.\n5.3.2. Example of resolution of a mechanism in an open system with constant\nconcentrations\nEquation [5.13] is kept and the constant concentrations of reactants and products\nare added to it:\n[A]=[A] and [B]=[B] [5.18]\n0 0\nThis gives us three equations for three unknowns. A speed equation is then\nchosen. Let us assume that it is the production of B from one mole of A:\nX B\nv B k' 2 k\" 2 [5.19]\nA A\n0 0\nFigure 5.3. a) Variations of the speed with time; and b) variations of the concentration of\nintermediate X with time for reaction [5R7] in a system with constant concentrations\nFigure 5.3a shows the variations of speed with time. We see that after a\ntransition period, the speed becomes independent of time. Figure 5.3b shows that\nafter the transition mode, the concentration of intermediate X remains constant.\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from this study of reaction [5.R7]:\n– the mathematical system we want to solve rapidly becomes complex and, in\nmost cases, only a numerical computation will enable us to obtain the solution.\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 99\nHowever, we still have to obtain the numerical values of the rate coefficients, which\nis rarely the case;\n– this solution depends on the operating conditions and the quantity chosen to\nexpress the speed.\nWe will now examine the mathematical formulation of some types of reactions.\n5.4. Mathematical formulation of a homogeneous reaction with open sequence\nWe will reconsider the example of the decomposition reaction of dinitrogen\npentoxide with its mechanism composed of steps, which are recalled below. The\nopposite steps of [5.R3b] and [5.R3c] are not taken into account:\nN 2 O 5  NO 2 + NO 3 [5.R8a]\nNO + NO → NO + NO + O [5.R8b]\n2 3 2 2\nNO + NO → 2NO [5.R8c]\n3 2\nThe two opposite rate coefficients of reaction [5.R8a] arek' and k\" , and those\n1 1\nof reactions [5.R8b] and [5.R8c] are k and k .\n2 3\n5.4.1. Mathematical formulation in a closed system\nInitially the reactor contains only nitrogen pentoxide, and the volume is constant\nthroughout the reaction. We have five unknowns – concentrations [N O ], [NO ],\n2 5 3\n[NO], [N O ], and [O ] – and the five following equations:\n2 4 2\n– the balance of the intermediate NO species:\n1 dNO d[NO]\n   \n2 3\nV dt dt [5.20]\nk NO NO k NON O \n2 2 3 3 2 5\n– the balance of the intermediate NO species:\n3\nd[NO ]\n3   k' N O k\" NO NO \n1 2 1 2 5 1 2 3\ndt [5.21]\nk NO NO \n2 2 3\n100 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n– oxygen conservation:\n5[N O ] 5[N O ]NO2NO 3NO 2O  [5.22]\n2 5 0 2 5 2 3 2\n– nitrogen conservation:\n2[N O ] 2[N O ]NO NO NO [5.23]\n2 5 0 2 5 2 3\nLet us choose to measure the speed of the reaction through the speed of oxygen\nproduction:\nd[O ]\nv  2   k NO NO  [5.24]\nO 2 2 2 3\ndt\nThe resolution of the system consisting of equations [5.20], [5.21], [5.22], [5.23]\nand [5.24] would enable us to obtain the chosen speed as a function of the variables\nof the problem: the initial concentration of pentoxide and time at a given\ntemperature. This involves knowing the values of the rate coefficients of the four\nelementary steps concerned. Figure 5.4 shows the concentration curves obtained\nfrom such a resolution for a set of values of these coefficients.\nFigure 5.4. Concentration versus time during the decomposition\nof dinitrogen pentoxide in a closed system\nIt can be seen that the concentrations of the intermediate species remain small\ncompared those of the initial and final products.\n5.4.2. Mathematical formulation of a system with constant concentrations\nWe start from an initial state containing nitrogen pentoxide, carbon dioxide and\ndioxygen in known concentrations. Thus, the intermediate concentrations and an\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 101\nexpression of speed remain unknown. We keep equations [5.20] and [5.21] to which\nwe add the following initial conditions:\n[N O ]=[N O ] ; NO =NO  ; O =O  [5.25]\n2 5 2 5 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\nBy assuming that the speed is measured by the heat flux involved, if H\ni\ndenotes\nthe enthalpy associated with step i, we will obtain:\ndQ\n k' N O ΔH  k'' NO NO ΔH'\n1 2 5 1 1 2 3 1\ndt [5.26]\n k NO NO ΔH' k NONO ΔH\n2 2 3 2 3 3 3\nThe resolution of the system consisting of equations [5.20], [5.21], [5.25] and\n[5.26] enables us to obtain the heat flux as a function of time and the initial\nconcentrations of the principal components of the reaction, which are held constant.\n5.5. Mathematical formulation of chain reactions\nWe will examine the mathematical formulation of chain reactions in terms of\ntwo examples: the first in a simple chain reaction; and the second in a reaction\nproducing macromolecules.\n5.5.1. Mathematical formulation of a simple homogeneous chain reaction\nWe will reason on hydrogen bromide synthesis (originally shown in [2.R2]):\nH + Br = 2HBr [5.R9]\n2 2\nWe have seen that the proposed mechanism of this reaction can be formulated, in\na simplified form, through the four steps that are recalled below:\nBr → 2Br (rate coefficient k' ) [2.R2a]\n2 1\nBr + H ↔ HBr + H (rate coefficients k' and k'' ) [2.R2b]\n2 2 2\nH + Br → HBr + Br (rate coefficient k ) [2.R2c]\n2 3\nBr + Br → Br2 (rate coefficient k''\n1\n) [2.R2d]\n102 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe will only consider the case of a closed system with constant volume and will\nstart with a known concentration of dihydrogen and dibromine.

It can be seen from the example of such a calculation, shown in Figure\n5.5, that the concentrations of intermediate species are extremely low compared to\nthose of the principal components.\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 103\nNOTE 5.3.– The thermal initiation step could be replaced by the same step\nperformed photochemically, i.e. with a speed proportional to light intensity at the\nappropriate wavelength.\nFigure 5.5. Variation of species concentrations during the chain reaction\nof hydrogen bromide synthesis\n5.5.2. Mathematical formulation of a reaction forming a macromolecule through\npolymerization\nHere we will only consider the case of a closed system with a constant volume.\n5.5.2.1. Speed of polymerization\nWe will illustrate polymerization through the example of a polymerization that,\nfrom a monomer (M), leads to the polymer P , where N is the average number of\nN\nmonomer molecules contained in a polymer molecule (such as an alkene). The\nreaction takes place in homogeneous phase and the volume remains virtually\nconstant during the reaction.\nWe assume that chain initiation is performed by an unstable substance S, which\nbreaks down into two activated radicals according to the following reaction:\nS 2R [5.R10a]\nc\nThe second step of the initiation is the reaction of one activated radical with a\nmonomer molecule in order to produce a new activated radical that contains a\nmonomer molecule according to the following reaction:\nR M R ° [5.R10b]\nc 1\n104 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIf k denotes the speed of the first step of the initiation and v the speed (per\ni i\n°\nunit volume) of radical formation R (in the second step), the balance with radical\n1\nR\nis written as follows:\nc\nd\n R\nc\n2k Sv [5.33]\ni i\ndt\nRadicals\nR\nthat were formed through the initiation phase are the propagation\n1\ncenters of the chain. They affect the monomer M according to the reaction:\nR ° M R [5.R10c]\n1 2\nand, recursively, each radical reacts with a monomer molecule in order to lengthen\nthe polymer radical:\nR M R [5.R10d]\n2 3\nR M R\nj j1 [5.R10e]\nIt is assumed that these reactions could continue indefinitely (j could increase\nindefinitely).\nThe breaking reaction occurs when two radicals of arbitrary length combine to\nproduce a polymer molecule according to:\nR R P\nj m jm [5.R10f]\nWe want to assess the extinction speed of the monomer. This involves positing\ntwo hypotheses:\n– It is assumed that the rate coefficients of reactions of a monomer binding to a\nradical have the same value k . This hypothesis is justified by the fact that in all\np\nthese reactions the same double bond (the monomer bond) is cut.\n– The constant k of breaking reactions is independent of the length of the\nt\nradicals (j and m) involved.\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 105\nThe monomer balance is written as follows:\n1 dM dM  \n   v φ  v k M  R [5.34]\ni j i P j\nV dt dt j j\nIn order to determine the concentrations of the various radicals, we should write\nthe balance for each of them:\n   \n1 d R dR\n1  1  v φ   φ \ni P 1 t j\nV dt dt j\n[5.35]\n     \n v  k M R  k R  R\ni P 1 t 1 j\nj\n \ndR\n2  φ     φ \nP 1 P 2 t j\ndt j\n[5.36]\n       \n k  M  R   R  k R  R\nP 1 2 t 2 j\nj\n \nd R\nj  φ   φ   φ \nP j1 P j t j\ndt j\n[5.37]\n       \n k M R  R  k R  R\nP j1 j t j j\nj\nThe resolution of the system consisting of equations [5.34] to [5.37] will\nnormally enable us to express the extinction speed of the monomer as a function of\ntime through parameters v, k and k . Unfortunately, we obtain a mathematic\ni P t\nsystem that is too complicated to be solved and in addition a primordial reason is\nthat the number of equations of the system varies with time (the problem’s variable).\nWe shall see in Chapter 7 how to bypass this difficulty.\n5.5.2.2. Degree of polymerization\nLet n denote the average number of monomers per radical formed. This number\nis defined by:\nnumber of monomeric units\nn [5.38]\nnumber of formed radicals\n106 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe note that for such a reaction, viewed as the result of breaking reactions, a\npolymerized molecule results from a breaking reaction of, on average, two radicals\nof the same length, n. Therefore, the chain length is on average the half of the\ndegree of polymerization. Thus the average degree of polymerization will be:\nN 2n [5.39]\nIn order to assess n, let us look at the evolution of a monomer radical R . It\n1\nreacts either with a monomer with a reaction probability p, or with another radical in\na breaking reaction with a probability 1 – p. Likewise, a radical\nR\nproduces\nR\n2 3\nwith a probability p and produces a polymer molecule with a probability 1 – p.\nIf the probability of encountering a radical\nR\nis 1, the probability of\n1\nencountering R is p, and R is p2, then the probability of encountering R is pj – 1.\n2 3 j\nThe overall number of radicals will then be (p < 1):\n1\n1 p p\n2\n... p\nj1\n [5.40]\n1 p\nThe number of monomeric units present in these radicals will be:\n1\n12p3p\n2\n... jp\nj1\n [5.41]\n2\n1 p\nWe deduce that the average number of monomers is:\n1\nn [5.42]\n1 p\nhence the average degree of polymerization is:\n2\nN  [5.43]\n1 p\nIt is necessary to evaluate the chain propagation probability p.\nLaws of Homogeneous Systems 107\nDuring the time interval dt:\n° °\n– the number of radicals R transformed into R is:\n1 2\nk M R °\nP  1\n°\n– the total number of radicals R that disappear (including the chains that use\n1\nthis radical breaking) is:\n \nk Mk R\nP t   j\n j \nhence, the value of the probability is obtained by the ratio of the number of\nfavorable cases to the number of possible cases:\nk M R\nP  1\np\n \nk MR k R R\nP  1 t  1   j\n j \n[5.44]\nk M\nP\n 1\n \nk Mk R\nP t   j\n j \nThis number will be easy to calculate if we have solved the system of equations\n[5.34] to [5.44], which means that we know the concentrations of all the radicals as a\nfunction of the variables and parameters. We will solve this problem later (see\nChapter 7, section 7.4.4).\nIn summary, the mathematical formulation of a mechanism will provide us with\nthe means to find the quantitative laws of evolution (extent–time, speed–time and\nspeed–extent) as well as the influence of concentrations on speeds. The influence of\ntemperature will only show up by making Arrhenius’ law explicit on the different\nrate coefficients.\n\nChapter 6\nExperimental Data and Calculation of\nKinetic Laws of Heterogeneous Reactions\nAlthough heterogeneous reactions have the same basic equations as\nhomogeneous reactions, they feature very different properties – mainly related to\ntheir multizone nature – and lead to very different kinetic laws and mathematical\nformulations of speed. Moreover, two new processes are involved:\n– adsorption related to the existence of gas–solid interfaces; and\n– diffusion related to the need to transport species from one zone to another.\n6.1. Heterogeneous reactions\n6.1.1. Distinctive nature of heterogeneous systems\nEach heterogeneous reaction exhibits several reaction zones and part of the\nreaction – a number of elementary steps – takes place within each of these. The sizes\nof these zones might vary simply because of the reaction.\nAn important consequence of the existence of several reaction zones is the\npresence of a process transporting species from one zone to another. Thus, the\ndiffusion phenomenon is always present in the mechanism of a heterogeneous\nreaction.\nA second consequence of the multizone nature of heterogeneous reactions is that\nthe elementary chemical steps will most often take place in 2D zones and will\ntherefore be characterized by surface reactivities and surface space functions.\n110 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n6.1.2. Rate of a heterogeneous reaction\nThe speed of a heterogeneous reaction (or its rate) is usually an extremely\ncomplex function that depends on physico-chemical and textural variables (shapes\nand phase dimensions). Generally, the volumetric or areal speed cannot be defined.\nDespite thus, a certain number of heterogeneous reactions follow the “E law”,\nwhich means that the rate can be written as a product of two functions as in the case\nof the elementary steps:\nr .E\nOne of these, , is expressed in mol/m2/s and only depends on intensive\nquantities: pressure, temperature, concentrations, light intensity, electric or magnetic\nfields, etc. It acts as an areal speed.\nThe other, E, is expressed in m2/mol and only depends on the morphological\ncharacteristics of the system.\nIn this book, unless explicitly stated otherwise, we will only consider the case of\nreactions that obey E law.\n6.1.3. Different kinetic classes of heterogeneous reactions\nThree families of heterogeneous reactions can be distinguished:\n– reactions that occur without the creation of a new condensed phase and without\na change in phase dimensions;\n– reactions that occur without the creation of a new condensed phase with\nchanges in dimensions of a solid phase; and\n– reactions that occur with the creation of a new condensed phase.\n6.1.3.1. Reactions that occur without creation of a new condensed phase and\nwithout change in phase dimensions\nIn this family we have:\n– catalytic reactions in which a condensed phase (usually a solid) affects the\nspeed of a reaction that involves only a single phase without consuming the solid\nphase;\n– gas dissolutions in which one or more gases dissolve in a liquid or solid phase.\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 111\n6.1.3.2. Reactions that occur without creation of a new condensed phase with\nchanges in dimensions of a solid phase\nThis family includes:\n– stoichiometric reactions of gasification during which only gases are obtained\nthrough the transformation of a solid, for example during coal gasification or UF\n6\nproduction through UF fluoridation;\n4\n– vaporization and sublimation transformations; and\n– dissolutions of a solid into a liquid or another solid.\n6.1.3.3. Reactions that occur with the creation of a new condensed phase\nIn this family there are:\n– Stoichiometric heterogeneous reactions: these are the chemical reactions that\nproduce a new solid B usually from a solid A, either through heating or through the\naction of another reactant (gas, liquid or solid). In addition to the new solid, these\nreactions eventually produce gases. They can be represented by the following\nreaction:\nA (ν G)ν B (ν G') [6.R1]\nG B G'\nWe classify them into three subfamilies:\n- decompositions of solids, such as the decomposition reaction of calcium\ncarbonate, used in the industrial preparation of lime:\nCaCO =CO +CaO [6.R2]\n3 2\n- gas–solid reactions, such as the reduction reaction of uranium oxide used in\nthe nuclear industry:\nH +U O =4UO +H O [6.R3]\n2 4 9 2 2\n- in this category, we can also find all the oxidation reactions of metals through\nhigh temperature gases, such as magnesium oxidation:\nMg+1/2O =MgO [6.R4]\n2\n112 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n– Reactions between solids that produce a new solid: such as the reaction\nbetween oxides of silicon and calcium used in the industrial manufacture of\ncements:\nSiO +CaO=Ca SiO [6.R5]\n2 3 5\nO\n2\nMgO\nMg\nFigure 6.1. The relative layout of phases during magnesium oxidation\nA reaction, such as [6.R4] for example, does not occur as simply as described by\nthe writing of the chemical reaction. In fact, the most elementary phenomena\ncombine together. For instance, it can be seen in Figure 6.1 that, in order to\ncontinue, the reaction requires permanent “contact” between the reactants, which are\nyet separated by the solid formed.\nThe following will not be covered in this book:\n– solid–liquid reactions that usually occur as the succession of two processes of\ndissolution and precipitation;\n– the condensation of gases or crystallization of liquids;\n– the precipitation of solids from liquids or solid solutions.\n6.2. Experimental kinetic data of heterogeneous reactions\nThe experimental kinetic data of heterogeneous reactions exhibit three aspects:\n– In this type of reaction, the reaction extent (or its speed) is usually measured as\na function of time. The system is closed with respect to the initial solid, if it is\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 113\ninvolved in the reaction, which is the basic constituent used to define the fractional\nextent.\n– Influences of concentrations, which are usually partial pressures of gases, and\nthe effect of temperature on speed are also studied, such as in homogeneous kinetics.\n– Finally, the influences of the solid phase, especially of its surface, or of grain\nsizes in the case of powders, are also important factors.\nNOTE 6.1.– In heterogeneous reactions that involve pure solids in their phase, it\nis not necessary to study the influence of solid concentration because this is a\nconstant (ratio of molar mass to molar volume) that cannot be changed from one\nexperiment to another. This does not mean that the amount of the solid phase has no\ninfluence on the speed and does not need to be studied, but rather that this quantity\nshould not be confused with a concentration.\n6.2.1. Catalytic reactions\nIt is very important to know the influence of time during a heterogeneous\ncatalytic reaction. This type of reaction is often assayed in an open circuit with\nrespect to gas, under gas flux. Either time has no influence on speed or there is a\ndecrease in the speed of reaction. The physico-chemical conditions remain constant\nduring the experiment and we talk about the catalyst aging, which is due to several\ncauses (see section 7.4.5).\nWhen it is possible to compare the kinetics of a reaction both with and without a\ncatalyst – which means that each reaction takes place at a suitable speed that can be\nmeasured under the same conditions of temperature and partial pressures by giving\nthe same final products – different speed–concentration relationships and different\ntemperature coefficients are obtained in both measuring conditions, proving the\ninfluence of the presence of the catalyst.\n6.2.1.1. Influence of partial pressures of gases\nIn the presence of a catalyst, different types of speed–partial pressure\nrelationships are obtained. In order to examine them, we consider two types of\nreactions to one or more reagents.\n6.2.1.1.1. Case of reactions with a single reactant\nThis reaction is represented through:\nA(gas)gaseous products [6.R6]\n114 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nExpressions that are apparently very different are identified. We get a speed\nwithout influence of partial pressures, such as:\ndP\n A Const [6.1]\ndt\nA speed proportional to the pressure of the reactant gas (first order):\ndP\n A kP [6.2]\nA\ndt\nor of first order with respect to the reactant and minus first order with respect to a\ngas product:\ndP kP\n A  A [6.3]\ndt P\nj\nHomographic laws with the pressure of the reactant are also encountered:\ndP k P\n A  1 A [6.4]\ndt 1k P\n2 A\nthat are of the first order with respect to the reactant and decrease with the pressure\nof a gas product:\ndP k P\n A  1 A [6.5]\ndt 1k P 2\n2 j\nIt will be seen that these relationships are specific forms of a more general\nexpression if we neglect some terms:\ndP k P\n A  1 A [6.6]\ndt 1k P\n2 j\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 115\n6.2.1.1.2.

Examples of the speed laws of a catalytic reaction\nwith two gaseous reactants\n116 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe results of such reactions are very diverse. These relationships appear to\nbelong to two families of functions. One of them, subject to various approximations,\nis derived from:\ndP k P P\n A  1 A B [6.7]\ndt   2\n\n1 k\ni\nP\ni\n\n i \nThe others can be obtained through the function given by:\ndP kRTS K P P\nA A A B\n  [6.8]\ndt Vs 1K P\ni i\ni\nTable 6.1 gathers examples of laws obtained with two gas reactants.\n6.2.1.2. The catalyst surface\nGenerally, absolute speeds are proportional to the catalyst area. This surface is\nthe real area, including pore walls (and not the outer area of the solid). It is called the\nspecific area (measured in m2/gram of the catalyst).\nThis proportionality of speed with catalyst initial area often disappears with time,\neither because the specific area decreases (coalescence of the catalyst) or a portion\nof the area no longer seems active for the reaction (catalyst poisoning).\n6.2.2. Stoichiometric heterogeneous gas–solid reactions\nIn heterogeneous kinetics with the creation of a new condensed phase, it is\ncommon to present experimental results under various equivalent forms. Thus there\nwill be: data of the fractional extent (restricted to a solid reactant) as a function of\ntime and data of the rate (or speed) versus the fractional extent as a function of\nintensive variables such as partial pressures of gases and temperature, versus the\npowder grain sizes forming one of the solid reactants. We will now quickly provide\nan outline of the results commonly obtained.\n6.2.2.1. E law for heterogeneous reactions\nWe have seen that for the heterogeneous reactions we use the E law. For the\nmoment we will only consider the stoichiometric reactions for which the space\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 117\nfunction depends on the fractional extent of the reaction alone and is independent of\nany other variable. This assumption will be abandoned in Chapter 14. We will thus\nhave:\ndα\n φ(T,P i ).E(α) [6.9]\ndt\n6.2.2.2. Fractional extent – time and speed – fractional extent curves\nWithin the framework of the reactions studied here, speed is a monotonic\nfunction of fractional extent (or time), see Figure 6.2b. It is continuously increasing,\ncontinuously decreasing or constant. The corresponding kinetic curves, see\nFigure 6.2a, therefore curve upwards, downwards or are in straight lines.\nFor these curves with monotone speed, different laws have been proposed.\nAmong the best known are linear law with constant speed [6.10] and the parabolic\nlaw [6.11] for plane solid samples:\nd\nkt or k [6.10]\ndt\n2\nd k\n kt or  [6.11]\ndt 2\nd\n dt\n1\n(b)\n(a)\n \nFigure 6.2. General paces of kinetic and speed curves\nfor stoichiometric heterogeneous reactions\n118 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe law known as the “shrinking core” for powders that consist of spherical\ngrains of equal size is written as follows:\nd\n2/3\n k(1) [6.12]\ndt\nA number of laws, like the shrinking core, appear in the following more general\nform:\nd\nn\nk(1) [6.13]\ndt\nIn these different expressions, k is a quantity that depends on the temperature\n(usually under the Arrhenius form) and partial pressures of gases. n takes different\nvalues: 1, 1/2, 2/3, etc. In fact, by referring to relation [6.9] we see that we follow\nthe variations of the space function E and that:\nk  [6.14a]\nNOTE 6.2.– Exponent n of equation [6.13] should never be confused with a\nreaction order, which is defined by speed–concentration relationships and not\nspeed–fractional extent. It is the same for coefficient k, which can be called a kinetic\ncoefficient. It should not be confused with a speed coefficient. Hence there are some\ncases where Arrhenius’ law is not followed.\n6.2.2.3. Variations of speed with intensive variables\nBy considering relation [6.9], the intensive variables are those of the function .\nFor thermal decomposition, a decreasing influence of pressure on speed is often\nhighlighted. It is rightly attributed to what might be called the thermodynamic-type\ninfluence: the speed decreases with the pressure of the gas product until it reaches a\nnull value for the equilibrium pressure.\nSome influences, of catalytic type, are occassionally attributed to steam, even\nthough this is not a main component of the reaction. For reactions between a gas and\na solid, it has been reported that the influences of partial pressure are extremely\nvaried, ranging from no the reactant gases having no influence to homographic\ninfluences of the pressure or its square root with expressions such as:\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 119\nd kP\n [6.14b]\ndt 1k'P\nd k P\n [6.15]\ndt 1k' P\nSome reactions have been reported that have an order with respect to the gas, but\nthese orders are often very fractional (1/4, 1/6, etc.). We can, however, say that the\nnotion of order has been completely dropped in heterogeneous kinetics due to the\nlow number of cases encountered.\nTo sum up, studies of the influence of partial pressures of gases are crucial for\nunderstanding the mechanisms of a reaction, such as the influence of the\nconcentrations of reactants and products in homogeneous kinetics.\nWith regards to the influence of temperature, Arrhenius’ law generally provides\na correct result, at least within a sufficiently small interval of temperature, and\nallows us to assign a temperature coefficient for wider intervals a change in the law\nof variation of the reactivity  with pressure is often reported, along with a change in\nthe temperature coefficient from one range of temperature to another.\n6.2.2.4. Influence of the shape and sizes of the solid reactant\nFor powder samples, the shape and size of the grains are of very high importance\nin kinetic or speed laws. If the assumption of proportionality of the space function to\nthe surface of an interface at any moment is accepted, the shape of the solid samples\noften determines the form of variation of speed with fractional extent, as shown by\nthe comparison of the two relations [6.10] and [6.12]. Coefficient n, which appears\nin the general form in [6.13], is partly due to the shape of the solid sample.\n6.3. Involvement of diffusion in matter balances\nIn homogeneous reactions, the laws were obtained by establishing a global\nbalance of species, which only involves reactions. Following the localization of\nphenomena, the study of heterogeneous systems requires the establishment of local\nbalances resulting from reactions and diffusions. We therefore wish to locally\nestablish the balance of a component subjected to several reactions and diffusion.\n120 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFigure 6.3. Volume of an element with diffusion: a) at the center;\nb) near an interface\nThis is performed by considering a portion (slice) of the volume located in the\nphase in which the component belongs. Within this slice, chemical reactions and\ndiffusion in a normal direction occur. We should distinguish two cases depending on\nwhether the slice is at the center of a volume zone (Figure 6.3a) or near an interface,\ni.e. in a 2D zone (Figure 6.3b).\n6.3.1. Balance in a slice of a volume zone\nA slice of thickness dx and surface S is located at the center of the phase in\nwhich component X belongs (Figure 6.3a).\nThe balance of X consists of two types of terms:\n– The source terms that are provided during the time dt by the speeds of\nchemical reactions that involve X in the slice. In each reaction  in which X is\ninvolved, its algebraic stoichiometric coefficient is  (which might be null if X is\n\nnot involved in the corresponding reaction).\n– The exchange terms that are due to diffusion across the surfaces that limit the\nvolume element. The flux diffusion is J at entry at the point of abscissa x and J\nx x + dx\nat the exit at the x + dx point of the abscissa.\nThe balance, which reflects the variation of the amount of X that is contained in\nthe slice during time dt, can thus be written as follows:\nX\n v  J J S [6.16]\nt  a  x xδx\n\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 121\nThe sum of the second member is extended to all the independent reactions that\ntake place in the slice.\nThe mean value theorem enables us to write:\nJ \nJ xδx J x  x  dx [6.17]\n x \nx\nand the balance relation becomes:\nX J \nt   v a     x x   S.dx\n x\nand by using Fick’s first law [3.32], we introduce the second derivative of the\nconcentration:\nX   2 [X]\n v    S.dx [6.18]\nt   a    x 2   x\nThis balance can also be expressed from the concentration of X. Here, we obtain:\nX 1 X XdV 1 X XdV\n .   .  [6.19]\nt V t V 2 dt V t V dt\nhence:\nX   v a      J x    XdV [6.20]\nt S.dx  x  V dt\n x\nand by using Fick’s first law and the volumetric speeds, we obtain:\n\nX \n\n2 [X] XdV\n ν v  D    [6.21]\nt ρ ρ ρ   x 2   V dt\nx\n122 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe term dV/dt reflects the variation in size of the zone during the progress of all\nthe reactions.\n6.3.2. Balance in a 2D zone\nA slice of thickness dx is located following the indication of Figure 6.3b near an\ninterface inside phase 1 in which component X exists.\nWe reason in the same way as previously, except that in the exchange term there\nis no diffusion flux across the direction normal to the surface at x + dx. If a chemical\nspecies passes through the interface, it is no longer the same component that is on\nthe other side: the interface’s traversal is actually a reaction of disappearance of the\ncomponent from the inside the slice, which is a source term.

Application of balances to the elementary steps of a sequence of reactions\nThe previous relations can be applied when all of the reactions involved consist\nof elementary steps.

Example of mathematical formulation of a heterogeneous catalytic reaction\nThus, let us consider the reaction of gas A that turns into gas B (such as an\nisomerization) catalyzed by a solid in a closed system at constant temperature:\nA = B [6.R8]\nAs the reaction takes place in a closed reactor, the catalyst is contained in the\nbottom of an air crucible with base S and height h. The catalyst forms a regular pile\nof height e (see Figure 6.4). The reaction is monitored through measurement of the\nconcentration of product B formed in the reactor near the exit of the crucible. [B ]\nh\nwill denote this concentration, which in practical terms is the one that prevails\nthroughout the reactor outside the crucible. The system temperature is kept constant.\nA heterogeneous catalytic reaction usually includes two reaction zones:\n– the diffusion zone between the catalyst and an adequate distance in the reactor\nwhere the concentrations are uniform; and\n– an adsorption zone and reaction on the catalyst surface.\nFigure 6.4. Catalytic reaction in a reactor\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 125\nIn these two zones, three groups of steps usually take place: the diffusions of\nreactants and products of the catalyst towards the exterior or the interior, adsorptions\nand desorptions of gas (or solutes) at the surface of the catalyst – the catalytic act –\nwhich is the chemical reaction itself, at the contact the catalyst.\nIn our specific case we will consider five elementary steps:\n– diffusion of reactant A from the top of the crucible, where we assume that the\npartial pressure no longer depends on coordinates of the space in the rest of the\nreactor up to the surface:\nA A [6.R8a]\nh e\n– adsorption of reactant A on sites s of the catalyst, which will be written as\nfollows:\nA s As [6.R8b]\ne\n– a chemical reaction that transforms A in the adsorbed phase into B in the\nadsorbed phase, which will be written as follows:\nAsBs\n[6.R8c]\n– desorption of product B according to:\nBsB s [6.R8d]\ne\n– diffusion of B towards the top of the crucible:\nB B [6.R8e]\ne h\nIf A and B denote the surface fractions covered by A adsorbed and B adsorbed,\nrespectively, the reactivity of each of the steps except diffusion is:\n k' [A ](1  )k\"  [6.33]\n2 2 e A B 2 A\n k'  k\"  [6.34]\n3 3 A 3 B\n k'  k\" [B ](1  ) [6.35]\n4 4 B 4 e A B\n126 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIt should be noted that we assumed that the molecules of A and B are located at\nthe same surface sites; a contrary assumption could be envisaged and is actually\nencountered.\nThe rate coefficients are calculated per area unit and, thus, conventional rate\ncoefficients are multiplied by the “thickness” of surface (a), which is invariable.\nFor diffusions, we dispose of both Fick’s laws for species A and B:\nA\nJ D [6.36]\nA A\ny\nA  2A\nD [6.37]\nt A y2\nB\nJ D [6.38]\nB B\ny\nB  2B\nD [6.39]\nt B y2\nNOTE 6.3.– Volume concentration is related to surface concentration through the\n“thickness” of the surface (a), which is invariable:\nX X.a [6.40]\ns\nLet us write the balances of the different species using [6.27] without surface\nvariation.

We can\nthus work per surface unit with a null volume and zone surface variation, hence the\nbalances in surface concentrations are:\ndθ\nA\n φ 2 φ 3 [6.42]\ndt\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 127\ndθ\nB\n φ 3 φ 4 [6.43]\ndt\n B \n e \nd\nB\ne\n\ns\n\n y\n\n e\n φ 4  D [6.44]\ndt e\nWe can add the closure condition of the system, which reflects the conservation\nof species:\nh A h B\nA   . dy A-sB-s  . dy [6.45]\n0 y y\ne e\nSpeed is measured through the production of B away from the catalyst:\nv \ndB\nh\n\ns \nD\n\n B\nh\n\n\n\n[6.46]\n \ndt e  y \nh\nThe resolution of the system of equations [6.33] to [6.46] enables us to express,\nat a given temperature, the speed as a function of time, initial concentration of the\nreactant A and various rate and diffusion coefficients. The complexity of all theses\nequations will lead us to detail different modes that will often enable us to simplify\nthe mathematical aspect of the problem, as discussed in Chapter 7.\n6.5. Example of the mathematical formulation of an evolution process of a\nphase\nWe will give the simplified mechanism of the evolution process of magnesium\noxide in the oxidation reaction of a magnesium plate as an example (see Figure 6.6).\nThe thickness of the magnesium plate is negligible compared to size of the top and\nbottom, so oxidation of the smaller faces becomes insignificant. Magnesium oxide is\nproduced by oxygen gas in isothermal conditions and under a constant pressure P of\npure oxygen. The overall reaction is:\n1\nMg+ O =MgO [6.R4]\n2\n2\n128 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nGiven relation [6.9], we will divide the modeling process into two parts:\n– a physico-chemical modeling of  by using a reaction mechanism as in\nhomogeneous kinetics to model an areal speed;\n– modeling of the space function that will take into account the shape of the\nsample.\nWe will only consider the example discussed at the first modeling and we will\nreturn to the dual modeling in Chapter 8 (section 8.1.5.2.5).\nMagnesium oxide is formed at the metal surface in a uniform layer that is\ninfinitely thin from the initial instant and grows perpendicularly to the surface.\nMagnesium oxide consists of two types of sites that are not normally empty in\nthe perfect crystal: divalent magnesium ions and oxygen ions. The building unit is\ncomposed of: Mg and O . This oxide admits a sub-stoichiometry in oxygen in\nMg O\nthe form of oxygen vacancies (see Appendix 1), which are assumed to be neutral:\nthe defect is thus composed of the entity denoted V .\nO\nThe mechanism can be written in four steps using Kröger’s notation (see\nAppendix 1):\n– at the surface of the dioxide formed, we have the dissociative adsorption of\noxygen on sites s according to:\nO 2s2Os [6.R4a]\n2\n– at the outer interface, oxygen vacancies (which will be formed at the inner\ninterface) react with this oxygen, which is adsorbed according to:\nV O  ext  O  s  O O  s [6.R4b]\n– oxygen vacancies diffuse from the inner interface toward the outer interface:\nV   V  [6.R4c]\nO int O ext\n– oxygen vacancies are formed from the metal at the inner interface, as follows:\nMgMg +(V ) [6.R4d]\nMg O int\nThe network of the metal is destroyed at the inner interface and the network\nconstruction of the new phase occurs at this same interface. The latter therefore\n“penetrates” the metal. It is said that the growth is with inner development (it\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 129\nshould be noted that this is not always the case – reactions exist for which the\nnetwork of the new phase is constructed at the outer interface, which are then said to\nbe outer development).\nWe verify that, after multiplying equation [6.R4a] by ½ and summing the four\nsteps, we obtain the overall reaction [6.R4], with the disappearance of intermediate\nspecies.\nWe will only consider systems operating in an open environment under constant\npressure with respect to gas with constant concentrations and closed with respect to\nthe solid.\nWe consider the case in which a plate of initial thickness e and of unit area is\n0\nattacked (see Figure 6.5).\nFigure 6.5. Attack on a plate of magnesium\n6.5.1. Balance of intermediates\nThese balances are derived from the general form of equation [6.22]. There are\nas many equations as there are intermediate, thus five in our example.\ni will denote the surface reactivity of reaction i and J will denote the flux of\noxygen vacancies – it can be taken at the inner (i) or outer (e) interface. The amounts\nof the various intermediates are taken at the inner (i) or outer (e) interface of areas\nS and S .\ni e\nWe thus have three equations: two at the outer surface [6.47] and [6.48]; and one\n[6.49] at the inner interface:\ndOs\n (2   )S [6.47]\n1 2 e\ndt\n130 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n  \nd V\nO\ne\n (J   )S [6.48]\ne 2 e\ndt\n  \nd V\nO\ni\n (  J )S [6.49]\n4 i i\ndt\n6.5.2. Expressions of the reactivities of elementary chemical steps\nThe reactivities of elementary reactions can be obtained through the application\nof van ’t Hoff’s principle, with  being the degree of recovery of oxygen adsorbed\nand P being the pressure of this gas. In our case, there are three reactivities and they\nare written as follows:\n2\n\n\n2 \n 1  k' 1 (1 ) P 1  2  [6.50]\n K\n1\n(1 ) P\n \n 1   \n 2  k' 2   V O  1   [6.51]\ne K  V O  \n 2  e\n V  \n  O \n 4  k' 4 1  i  [6.52]\nK\n 4 \n \n6.5.3.

Diffusion equations of the defects\nC will denote the concentration in oxygen vacancies at x, which depends on x,\nand the time. D will denote the diffusion coefficient of oxygen vacancies, which is\nassumed to be constant. Given the geometry of the system, we use the flux\nexpression according to Fick’s first law:\nC\nJ   D. [6.55]\nx\nFrom Fick’s second law in the dioxide layer, we obtain:\n2\nC  C\n D [6.56]\nt x 2\nThe application of this expression to the concentration at the inner and outer\ninterfaces enables us to calculate the concentrations of species at the interfaces:\nV  C (Y ) [6.57a]\n O\ni\nand:\nV  C(Y  X) [6.57b]\n O\ne\nFrom the application of the flux functions to the inner and outer interfaces, we\nobtain:\nJ  J [6.58a]\ni Y\nJ  J [6.58b]\ne YX\n132 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n6.5.5. Expressions of the variations in sizes of the zones involved in the reaction\nThe new phase is produced through step [6.R4d] at the inner interface and\npenetrates into the first phase (see Figure 6.5). With V being the molar volume of\nM\nthe oxide, let us write the volume of the former phase consumed during the time dt:\nsdY V  sdt [6.59]\nM 4\nLet us write that the ratio between the volume of the oxide formed and the\nvolume of the metal from which it is derived is the expansion coefficient z:\nsX zs(e  Y) [6.60]\n0\nThe areas of the inner and outer surfaces each have the value of 1 m2 (s = 1).\n6.5.6. Evolution law of the rate chosen to characterize the speed\nWe have seen that we can define as many fractional extents and rates as the\nnumber of components that are present in the overall reaction.\nThus in the chosen example, the step that decays the metal is [6.R4d]. The rate\nwith respect to reactant A (here magnesium), is therefore:\nd α Mg S i φ 4\n φ 4  [6.61]\ndt n n\n0 0\nWith respect to the solid formed (magnesium oxide), the step that produces this\nsolid is still [6.R4d] and therefore we will have the same expression as before:\ndα S φ\nMgO  φ i  4 [6.62]\n4\ndt n n\n0 0\nThe rate with respect to the gas (oxygen) takes a different form, however,\nbecause this gas is consumed through step [6.R4a], thus the corresponding rate will\nbe:\ndα S φ\nO  φ e  1 [6.63]\n1\ndt n n\n0 0\nLaws of Heterogeneous Reactions 133\nThe resolution of one of the resulting systems of equations – depending on\nwhether we use [6.61] [6.62] or [6.63] – enable us to calculate, through integration,\none of the rates and one of the fractional extents as a function of time, oxygen\npressure and temperature via the constants specific to a reaction.\nNOTE 6.4.– There is no reason for the different rates to be identical and lead to\nthe same expressions and vary in the same manner with the different variables, since\nwe sometimes have distinct equations of definition: [6.61] or [6.62] and [6.63].\nTo conclude, it can be seen that the quantitative knowledge of the reaction from\nthe mechanism requires the resolution of a system of differential equations that gives\nthe balance of each intermediate and some of the main components. To these we can\nadd algebraic equations that capture either the conservation of matter in a closed\nsystem or the fixed concentrations in open system. The resulting system, which is\nnot always linear and whose rate coefficients are unknown, therefore leads to a\ncomplex problem. We are thus led to seek approximate analytical solutions by using\nphysical assumptions that simplify the system of equations. The resulting special\nsolution characterizes a kinetic mode. For a given reaction there are as many kinetic\nmodes as there are special solutions.\n\nChapter 7\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes\nWe have seen that the calculation of reaction rates from mechanisms quickly led\nto complex systems of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically or\nnumerically because the numerical values of the rate coefficients involved are\nunknown. Fortunately, in a very large number of cases, reactions occur according to\npermanent or quasi-permanent modes so it is possible to identify them\nexperimentally. This simplifies the equations, thus enabling us to obtain expressions\nof speed that can then be compared to the experiment in order to validate the\nmechanisms.\nConcepts of the pseudo-steady and quasi-steady states are apparently very close\nto one another. However the difference is fundamental. Whereas the pseudo-steady\nstates define kinetic modes of reaction, the quasi-steady states are simple\nmathematical approximations. Moreover the difference is palpable in the sense that\nthe first concept can be directly checked by the experiment independently of the\nkinetic law, the second is checked only by the conformity between the kinetic law\nspeed, concentrations calculated and the experimental corresponding law. But many\nother factors must intervene in addition so that these two laws coincide, in particular\na correct choice of the mechanism of the reaction.\n7.1. Pseudo-steady state mode\n7.1.1. Definition\nA mode is said to be in pseudo-steady state if the amount of each of the\nintermediates remains small compared to the amounts of the principal components\n136 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nof the reaction and if this amount hardly varies with time. Therefore, the pseudo-\nsteady state mode will be defined through two conditions:\ndX \ni 0 and X  small i [7.1]\ni\ndt\nWe have already seen in Figure 5.2 that these conditions are roughly met for our\nreference reaction [5.R7] for the chosen values of speed coefficients.\nSuch a mode would not be a good approximation at the reaction start and end,\nbecause neither of the two conditions [7.1] will be met in a closed system. At the\nreaction start, the intermediaries that are not at the origin appear and therefore their\nconcentration is not constant and negligible compared with that of the products.\nLikewise these intermediates should vanish at the reaction end. We will see that\nthese conditions are often acceptable, however, with respect to measurement\naccuracy.\n7.1.2. Uniqueness of the reaction speed in pseudo-steady state mode\nWhen we have written that the extent of the reaction follows relation [1.3], the\nlatter does not depend on the chosen component. This implies that the extent of the\nreaction does not depend on the component chosen to define it, which means that the\nstoichiometry relation among the components can be observed at any time. This is\nstrictly true if the reaction occurs in a single step (in the case of elementary steps). If\nseveral steps are involved, however, during a given time period there can be\naccumulation (positive or negative) of one or more intermediates which will lead to\nthe non-compliance of the stoichiometry relation among the main components of the\nreaction. Therefore, the speed will depend on the component chosen to define it, as\nwe have already noted in the conclusions of section 5.2 (Chapter 5) and shown in\nFigure 7.1, which for certain values of the rate coefficients for our reference reaction\n[5.R7], gives different extents depending on whether the fractional extent is defined\nfrom the concentrations of reactant A or the amount of product B.\nIf the system is in the pseudo-steady state mode, every intermediate will be at a\nconstant amount over time and therefore the stoichiometry relation will be preserved\nthroughout the reaction. Thus, we can state the following theorem:\nTHEOREM 7.1.– The extent and speed of a reaction in pseudo-steady state mode\nis independent of the component chosen to define them.\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 137\nFollowing this theorem, we can talk about the extent and speed of a reaction in\npseudo-steady state conditions. In other cases the definition of these quantities must\nbe specified and we usually obtain speeds that depend on the component chosen to\ndefine it.\nFigure 7.1. Differences among extent curves depending\non the component it is defined from\n7.1.3. Linear sequences in pseudo-steady state modes\nWe will demonstrate two properties of linear sequences in pseudo-steady state\nmodes.\nFor this we will use a linear sequence containing intermediates X , X … X\n1 2 i\nproduced by steps 1, 2… i succeeding one another to yield a reaction that produces\nB from A.\n7.1.3.1. Multiplying coefficients and elimination of intermediates\nIt is known that a linear combination of all steps should eliminate the\nintermediate species, since they do not exist at the beginning or end of the reaction.\nIn this linear combination, step  is weighted by a coefficient  , which is called the\n\nmultiplying coefficient of step .\nSince there is an elimination of intermediates, for a component X weighted by\ni\nthe stoichiometric algebraic coefficient i in the -th step we should therefore\nhave:\n  0 [7.2]\ni, \n\n138 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIn fact there is an infinite series of multiplying coefficients, all proportional to\neach other. For the main component A whose algebraic stoichiometric coefficient in\nthe overall reaction is A , the following relation should be respected:\n   [7.3]\nA,  A\n\n7.1.3.2. Equality of speeds law for linear pseudo-steady state sequences\nWe will prove the following theorem.\nTHEOREM 7.2.– In the pseudo-steady state mode of a linear sequence, the rates of\ntwo arbitrary steps are proportional to each other and the proportionality ratio is the\ninverse of the ratio of their multiplying coefficients.\nLet us prove the direct theorem by writing the balance for each of the\nintermediates (by applying relation [5.11] to this intermediate) and let us prove that\nthis balance is zero in order to apply the pseudo-steady state, for instance, to the\nintermediary X produced by step i and consumed by step i + 1:\ni\ndX \ni\n (  E    E ) n 0 [7.4]\ni,i i i i,i1 i1 i1 0\ndt\nWhere i is the multiplying coefficient of step i, the application of relation [7.1]\nleads to:\n    [7.5]\ni i,i i1 i,i1\nBy combining [7.4] and [7.5], we can calculate:\n E   1,2  E   1  2 E 2 [7.6]\n1 1 2 2\n \n1,1 2\nfrom which we deduce:\n1 1 1 1\n E  ...   E  ...   E   E [7.7]\n1 1 i i n n n1 n1\n   \n1 i n n1\nwhich proves the theorem.\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 139\nLet us now examine the reciprocal. Let us assume that all the absolute speeds are\nproportional to each other, which means that we have:\n1 1 1\n E  ...   E  ...   E\n1 1 i i n n\n  \n1 i n [7.8]\nLet us apply [7.8] to the balance of species X :\ni\ndX \ni\n(  E   E ) n  E (    ) n\ni,i i i i,i1 i1 i1 0 i i i,i i i,i1 i1 0\ndt\n[7.9]\nAccording to [7.5], the last members of the equalities of this type are zero\nregardless of i and the mode is in pseudo-steady state, which shows our reciprocal.\nThus, in pseudo-steady state conditions, for a linear mode we obtain:\n E\n \nConst [7.10]\n\n\nThis theorem is sometimes called the equality of speeds theorem because we\nnotice that if all the multiplying coefficients are equal, then the rates and thus the\nspeeds of elementary steps are equal.\n7.1.3.3. Reaction speed of a linear sequence in pseudo-steady state mode\nLet us reconsider expression [5.11] for the balance of A. By taking into account\n[7.10] we obtain:\ndA  v   E n   A,     k E k n   [7.11]\na A k k 0 0 A, \ndt  \n k k \nand by utilizing [7.5], it becomes:\n E\nv  k k n [7.12]\na 0\n\nk\nor for the rate:\n E\nr  k k [7.13]\n\nk\nwe can therefore state the following theorem.\n140 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nTHEOREM 7.3.– The rate of a reaction with a linear mechanism in pseudo-steady\nstate mode is the product of the reactivity of any of its steps times the space function\nof that step divided by the multiplying coefficient of that step.\nNOTE 7.1.– In the case of heterogeneous systems that may possibly involve\ndiffusion, let us recall that the space function involves the shape factor G, which\nequals one for a reaction and is given by [3.38] for a unidirectional diffusion.\n7.1.4. Multipoint sequences in pseudo-steady state mode\nLet us now consider a sequence containing a multiple point (see Figure 7.2) that\ninvolves four intermediates through the following four steps [7.R1a] to [7.R1d]:\nX\n4\nX\nX 1\n2\nX\n3\nFigure 7.2.

Equality of speeds law for pseudo-steady state multipoint sequences\nLet us now examine the conditions of pseudo-steady state. Since the mechanism\nis no longer linear, we cannot apply the equality of speeds theorem. The mass\nbalances of the intermediates should be cancelled out as follows:\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 141\ndX \n2  n   E  (  E    E   0 [7.14]\n0 2,2 2 2 2,3 3 3 2,4 4 4)\ndt\nhowever, according to the elimination rule:\n     \n2,2 2 2,3 3 2,4 4\nso we deduce:\n E  E  E\n2 2\n\n3 3\n\n4 4\n[7.15]\n  \n2 3 4\nThis result is equivalent to the equality of speeds theorem for multiple points.\n7.1.4.2. Reaction speed with a multipoint sequence in pseudo-steady state mode\nLet us calculate the contribution of the multipoint sequence to the speed of\ndisappearance of reactant A. From relation [5.11], we obtain:\ndA\n n    E   E   E  [7.16]\n0 A,2 2 2 A,3 3 3 A,4 4 4\ndt\nThe pseudo-steady state condition will be expressed by equation [7.14] and we\nshall take into account that, for the entire reaction, the law of definition of\nmultiplying coefficients [7.3] should be met for each linear sequence.\n7.1.5. Experimental research into the pseudo-steady state\nGiven the simplification introduced by the pseudo-steady state modes, it is\nimportant to know experimentally whether such a mode is acceptable for the\nreaction studied given the precision of experimental data, and this by setting apart\nany idea about mechanisms. Therefore, the method of two speed measurements is\nused.\n7.1.5.1. Principle of the method\nThis principle involves using the unique property of the extent or speed of\npseudo-steady state (see section 7.1.2) by measuring one of these quantities using\ntwo different methods, including the largest number of elementary steps. At least\none of these methods is the technique usually used for the study of kinetics. In order\nto choose these two methods, it is suggested we use the monitoring technique of the\nchosen reaction, on one hand, and calorimetry, on the other hand, because the\n142 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nreaction speed expression through calorimetry includes all the elementary steps that\nfeature an enthalpy, which means the greatest number. The choice of the methods\nused to monitor the reaction enables us to test the confidence interval of this\ntechnique and thus to make the test consistent with experimental precision. If the test\nis positive, it means that a pseudo-steady state mode will be sufficiently good to\ndescribe the evolution of the system studied.\nNOTE 7.2.– We have seen (see section 4.3) that Bodenstein measured the\ndecomposition of hydrogen iodide by following the iodine released through\niodometry, the hydrogen released through volumetry and the hydrogen iodide\nformed by acidimetry. The results overlap: the author believed that he had verified\nhis results by utilizing three methods. In fact he has proven that he can use the\nsteady state mode to determine the reaction in view of his experiments.\nOn the same graph we plot the speed obtained through both methods:\ncalorimetry and the method used to monitor the reaction (see below) versus time\n(see Figure 7.3).\nIf the ratio of two lengths (MA/MB) does not depend on time, the system is in\npseudo-steady state. This is seen (Figure 7.4) by calculating the ratio of two\nmeasures at a given time and by recalculating one curve from the other applying the\npreceding ratio at all times. If the two new curves are confounded with one another\nversus time, then the system is in pseudo-steady state.\nFigure 7.3. Comparison of two physical measures related to the reaction\n7.1.5.2. Experimental method\nWe chose the heat flow as one of the measures that involves all of the elementary\nsteps that feature a non-zero enthalpy. As a second measure, we utilize the method\nthat has been chosen to monitor the system. Let us assume the following choices:\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 143\n– in homogeneous kinetics, the speed will be measured through monitoring the\nconcentration of a reactant;\n– in heterogeneous kinetics, the variation of solid phases’ mass and heat flow is\nused in both cases.\nWe will examine the expression of variation in the speeds of these three\nquantities as a function of the speeds of the elementary steps for a linear reaction\nmechanism.\n7.1.5.2.1. Heat flux during a reaction\nA heat flux is involved in each of the steps and is characterized by the step’s\nenthalpy (H . Therefore, the heat flow (produced or consumed) will be:\ndQ\n n  H  E [7.17]\ndt 0    \n\nIn pseudo-steady state condition, by using [7.10] for a linear sequence and\ndenoting an arbitrary step of the mechanism i, the heat flow (produced or consumed)\nwill be:\ndQ  E\n n i i  H   [7.18]\n0  \ndt \ni \nDespite this, the enthalpy of the overall reaction obeys the following relation:\nH    H  [7.19]\n \n\nthus the flow in the pseudo-steady state condition (by using [7.12]) is:\ndQ  E\n n i i H n rH [7.20]\n0 0\ndt \ni\n7.1.5.2.2. Concentration speed of reactant A\nThe concentration speed is obtained through:\ndA n\n 0   E   [7.21]\nA,   A, \ndt V\n \n144 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe sum is composed of all the steps in which component A is involved, which\nmeans those for which the stoichiometric coefficient  relative to A is not zero.\nA,\nIn a homogeneous medium, all elementary steps have the same space function,\nwhich is the volume per mole occupied by the reaction.\nSince the mode is in the pseudo-steady state, the equality of speeds law allows us\nto replace all the reactivities by the reactivity of any step i:\ndA \n i   [7.22]\nA, \ndt \ni \nWe remember the relation between the stoichiometric coefficients of each step\nand the stoichiometric coefficient of component A in the overall reaction:\n   [7.23]\nA,  A\n\nBy including it in [7.22] and including the reactivity r of the reaction, we obtain:\ndA   n r\n\nA i\n\n0\n[7.24]\ndt  V\ni\nBy taking into account [7.20], the ratio R of the calorimetric speed to the\nconcentration speed gives:\ndA\n\n \nA, \nR  dt     A [7.25]\ndQ n   H V n VH\n0   0\ndt \nIt appears that if the reaction is carried out at constant volume during the\nmeasurement of the concentrations this ratio R is independent of time. The same\nreasoning that would lead to the same qualitative result could be conducted for any\nquantity: concentration of another reactant but also concentrations of products,\ndensity of the medium, etc. Any method (see Chapter 4) to monitor homogeneous\nreactions.\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 145\n7.1.5.2.3. Mass variation during a heterogeneous gas–solid reaction\n will denote the algebraic stoichiometric number of gas G (which is\nG,\npositive for a gas produced by the reaction and negative for a reactant gas) in the -\nth reaction mechanism and of rate  E . This stoichiometric number is zero if the\n \ngas G is not involved in this reaction.\nFrom the balances, the speed of mass increase is:\nd(m) dG\nM  n M   E [7.26]\nG 0 G   \ndt dt\n\nThe sum is extended to all the elementary steps in which the gas is involved.\nIn pseudo-steady state mode, by using expression [7.10] in relation [7.25] and\nchoosing any one of the steps i of the mechanism, the speed of mass increase\nbecomes:\ndm  E\nn i i   M   [7.27]\n0  G \ndt \ni \nHowever, the stoichiometric coefficients of the gas in the elementary steps and in\nthe overall reaction are connected through:\n    [7.28]\n G G\nand, by using [7.12], we obtain the expression of the speed of mass variation in a\npseudo-steady state system:\ndm  E\n n M  i i  n M  r [7.29]\n0 G G 0 G G\ndt \ni\nLet us now examine the ratio of the speed of mass variation to the heat flow.\nAccording to [7.20] and [7.29], this ratio is usually:\nM   E\nG   \n\nR [7.30]\n H   E\n  \n\n146 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nand in pseudo-steady state mode, this ratio becomes:\nM \nG G\nR i [7.31]\nH\nThus this ratio is independent of time (independent of the different reactivities\nand space functions) and is linked to the ratio of the molar mass of the gas to the\nenthalpy of the reaction for a pseudo-steady state mode.\nNOTE 7.3.– It is necessary to quantitatively examine the value of the ratio\nbecause a ratio independent of time can be fortuitously found even if the mode is not\nin the pseudo-steady state. The experiment should therefore be repeated, not in\nisothermal conditions but, for example, in linearly increasing temperature because\nthe chances of curves overlapping without being in pseudo-steady state mode\nbecome extremely low.\n7.1.5.3. Examples\nFigure 7.4 shows an example of two curves of the speed of variation of mass and\nheat flow in the case of magnesium oxidation after application of the overlap ratio.\nWe see that the pseudo-steady state system is quite acceptable and could be retained\nas a working assumption.\nFigure 7.4. Examples of a pseudo-steady state mode\nduring magnesium oxidation\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 147\nFigure 7.5 shows the same curves during the study of triuranium octoxide\naccording to:\nU O +2H =3UO +2H O [7.R2]\n3 8 2 2 2\nFigure 7.5. Test of pseudo-steady state during\na uranium oxide reduction by hydrogen\nWe see that the assumption of an overall pseudo-steady state cannot be retained.\nOn the other hand, a detailed review shows that, over time, three successive periods\nof pseudo-steady state with different ratios can be considered. This suggests the\nsuccession of three reactions, each in pseudo-steady state mode.\n7.2. Pseudo-steady state sequences with constant volume (or surface) – quasi-\nsteady state\n7.2.1. Quasi-steady state sequences\nLet us express the balance of an intermediate as a function of concentration. By\ndefinition of the concentration we have:\nX VX  [7.32]\ni i\n148 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThrough derivation, the following can be written:\ndX  dX  d lnV\ni V i X  [7.33]\ni\ndt dt dt\nIf for all the intermediates, the volumes of their phases do not vary and the mode\nis in pseudo-steady state, then we obtain:\ndX \ni\n0 [7.34]\ndt\nThus for a homogeneous system operating at constant volume, the pseudo-steady\nmode gives the same result as the Bodenstein quasi-steady state approximation. We\ncan say that we have a quasi-steady state mode.\nSince quasi-steady modes at constant volume are also in pseudo-steady state,\nthey feature all of the latter’s properties.\n7.2.2. Linear sequences in quasi-steady state mode\nWe will now focus our attention on linear sequences in quasi-steady state mode,\nwhich are of great practical importance in homogeneous kinetics.\n7.2.2.1. Equality of speeds law for homogeneous linear quasi-steady state sequences\nwith invariant volume\nIn quasi-steady state mode, for a linear sequence of a homogeneous system we\ncan prove a theorem symmetrical to the very general one obtained for pseudo-steady\nstate modes.\nBy making the spatial function explicit, it can be written from relation [7.10]\nthat:\n V\n\nConst [7.35]\nn \n0 \nand since the system volume s is constant, we obtain:\n\n\nConst [7.36]\n\n\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 149\n7.2.3. Speed of a homogeneous linear sequence in quasi-steady state mode with\ninvariant volume\nIf the system volume is unique, by using [7.12] and by making the spatial\nfunction explicit we can write:\n V\nv  k [7.37]\na\n\nk\nSo in terms of speed per volume unit:\nφ\nv  k [7.38]\n\nk\nThis is a simple relationship by which to calculate a volumetric speed where we\nknow the reactivity of a single elementary step.\n7.2.4. Multipoint sequences in quasi-steady state mode\nLet us now introduce a multiple point reaction of the type shown in Figure 7.2.\nIn quasi-steady state mode, for a multipoint sequence of a homogeneous system,\nwe prove a theorem symmetrical to the very general one obtained for pseudo-steady\nstate modes.\nBy making the spatial function explicit, it can be written from relation [7.15] as:\n V  V  V\n2 2\n\n3 3\n\n4 4\n[7.39]\n  \n2 3 4\nand since all the volumes are identical, we obtain:\n  \n2\n\n3\n\n4\n[7.40]\n  \n2 3 4\nIn the case of surface reactions, if the area is the same for all steps, using\nequation [7.15] yields:\n G  G  G\n2 2\n\n3 3\n\n4 4\n[7.41]\n  \n2 3 4\n150 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIt should be noticed that, in the case of diffusion, the product  G is the\n \ndiffusion flux.\n7.3. Pseudo- and quasi-steady state of diffusion\nLet us consider a diffusion path between two surfaces of areas S and S (see\n1 2\nFigure 7.6). The application of pseudo-steady state to diffusion leads to the\nfollowing invariant:\nJS  const [7.42]\nso in our case:\nJ S  J S [7.43]\n1 1 2 2\nJ\n2\nS\n2\nJ S\n1 1\nFigure 7.6. Diffusion path\nIn the case where diffusion is in the quasi-steady state, the flux will be deduced\nfrom the following equation:\nX  2X\n D 0 [7.44]\nt x2\nFor diffusion between two planes, the steady flux is therefore “quasi-steady” and\nis obtained from relation [3.38]. Since this flux is independent of the space, its\nproduction by a surface that remains constant will be invariant and therefore the\nquasi-steady diffusion across a constant surface is pseudo-steady.\nWe will therefore assume that quasi-steady diffusion is generally pseudo-steady.\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 151\n7.4. Application to the calculation of speeds in pseudo-steady state or quasi-\nsteady state\nExperience shows that in many cases pseudo-steady state modes are acceptable\nsolutions for the kinetic results of reactions such as the expression of speed as a\nfunction of different variables.\n7.4.1. Principle of the method\nFrom an assumed mechanism, after having verified the adequacy of the pseudo-\nsteady state approximation, we will seek the kinetic laws applicable to these pseudo-\nsteady state modes. The results can then be compared with those from the\nexperiment.\nGiven the growing number of relations that constitute equations [7.3], [7.10],\n[7.13], [7.15], [7.30], [7.37], [7.39] and [7.40] – which are individual cases – special\nattention to their application is required. Generally, for heterogeneous reactions, we\nrecommend making general relation [7.4] void for each intermediate in order to\ncalculate a speed. In the context of homogeneous reactions taking place at constant\nvolume, provided that we remain aware of these restrictions we can apply the\nconcentration balance.\n7.4.2. Example 1: dinitrogen pentoxide decomposition\nWe will reconsider reaction [2.R3] from section 5.4 with its three steps [5.R8a],\n[5.R8b] and [5.R8c]. We see that the three multiplying coefficients are equal to one.\nSince the reaction is homogeneous, the three steps take place in the same\ninvariant volume and we make the concentration balances of both intermediates void\nin order to apply the pseudo-steady state. Thus by making [5.20] and [5.21] void, we\nobtain:\nd[NO]\nk NO NO k NON O 0 [7.45]\n2 2 3 3 2 5\ndt\nd[NO ]\n3 k' N O k\" NO NO k NO NO 0 [7.46]\n1 2 5 1 2 3 2 2 3\ndt\n152 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe deduce:\nk' N O  k' k\nNO  1 2 5 and NO 1 2 [7.47]\n3 (k\" k )NO  k (k' k )\n1 2 2 3 1 2\nThe speed is obtained from [5.24]:\ndO \nv  2  k NO NO  [7.48]\n2 2 3\ndt\ntherefore:\nv=k' [N O ]=k[N O ] and E =E' [7.49]\n1 2 5 2 5 a 1\nWe thus obtain a volumetric speed that is proportional to nitrogen pentoxide\nconcentration as if the overall reaction [2.R4] was elementary, except that the\ncoefficient k is not a rate coefficient and does not follow Arrhenius’ law since\nconstants k' k'' and k , which are rate coefficients, follow it. However if:\n1 1 2\n– k\" k we obtain k k' which becomes an rate coefficient, and Arrhenius’\n1 2 1\nlaw is followed with an activation energy equal to that of step 1 from left to right:\nv  k' N O  kN O  [7.50a]\n1 2 5 2 5\n– k\" k we obtain k k' k /k'' and Arrhenius’ law is followed with an\n1 2 1 2 1\napparent activation energy equal to:\nE E' E E\" [7.50b]\na 1 2 1\nIn the general case, the global constant k no longer obeys Arrhenius law. If the\nexperiment gives a correct agreement with this law, the temperature coefficient no\nlonger carries any physical meaning.\n7.4.3. Example 2: hydrogen bromide synthesis\nWe refer to section 5.5.1 and, by making them void, reconsider expressions\n[5.27] and [5.28]. We obtain:\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 153\nd[H]\nk' BrH k'' HHBrk HBr 0 [7.51]\n2 2 2 3 2\ndt\nd[Br] 2\n2k' Br k' H Brk HBr 2k' Br 0 [7.52]\n1 2 2 2 3 2 1\ndt\nwhich enables us to deduce that:\nk' Br  k\" BrH \nBr 1 2 ; H 1 2 [7.53]\nk\" k' HBrk Br \n1 2 3 2\nBy including this in [5.29] and [5.32], the volumetric speed of hydrogen bromide\nformation is obtained using:\nk' k H Br 1/2\n1 3 2 2\nv  [7.54]\n k\" HBr\nk 1 1 \n4 k Br  \n 2 2 \nNOTE 7.4.– It should be seen that, as in the previous example, the calculation of\nthe formation speed from any reactant or product of the reaction leads to the same\nresults.\nWe can now examine the influence of temperature on speed.\nLet us reconsider expression [7.54]. Coefficients k' , k'' , k , k and k are all rate\n1 1 2 3 4\ncoefficients that obey Arrhenius’ law with a temperature coefficient equal to the\nactivation energy of the corresponding steps. The speed will not obey Arrhenius’\nlaw. However, if the experimental results agree with each other, and with a straight\nline in coordinates (ln v, 1/T), the calculated temperature coefficient will carry no\nphysical meaning.\nOn the other hand, it should be noted that the initial speed (without hydrogen\nbromide) is written as follows:\n1/2\nk' k H Br \n1 3 2 2\nv [7.55]\nk\n4\n154 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nHence the reaction admits orders 1 and 1/2 with respect to hydrogen and\nbromine, respectively. Depending on the temperature, we will find Arrhenius’ law\nwith an apparent activation energy, which is:\nE E\nE E'  3  4 [7.56]\na 1\n2 2\n7.4.4. Example 3: polymerization\nWe refer to section 5.5.2, and in order to apply the pseudo-steady state, we will\ncancel out expressions [5.34] to [5.37]:\ndM\nv k M R 0 [7.57]\ndt i P  j\nj\ndR\n 1 v k M R k R R 0 [7.58]\ndt i P  1 t  1  j\nj\ndR\n 2 k M R  R k R R 0 [7.59]\ndt P  1  2 t  2  j\nj\ndR\n j k M R   R k R R 0 [7.60]\ndt P  j1  j t  j  j\nj\nBy adding all these new equalities separately, which gives:\n 2\nv k R 0 [7.61]\ni t  j \n J \nand incorporating it into [5.34], the speed of decrease of the monomer concentration\nbecomes:\ndM v\n v k M i [7.62]\ni P\ndt k\nt\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 155\nBy analogy, we pose:\nv\nv k M i [7.63]\nP P\nk\nt\nThis reveals the speed of monomer disappearance as the sum of two terms:\n– the initiation speed v; and\ni\n– the “propagation speed” v .\nP\nDepending on the case, v could be ignored compared to v .

Example 4: application of the pseudo-steady state to a heterogeneous\ncatalytic reaction\nHere we will use the example of the catalysis discussed in section 6.4. We will\nignore the reactions from right to left (k\" k\" k\" 0). We will also ignore\n2 3 4\nthe portion of the catalyst surface occupied by an adsorbed gas compared with the\nfree surface (  1).\nA A\nBy applying the pseudo-steady state to the diffusion of A and B, we calculate:\nA A \n h  e\nJ D [7.70]\nA A\nhe\nB B \n e  h [7.71]\nJ D\nB B\nhe\nWe will assume that the diffusion coefficients of the two gases are identical and\nequal to D.\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 157\nApplying the pseudo-steady state by setting equations [6.42] to [6.44] to zero\nand by taking into account relations [6.17] to [6.19], [7.70] and [7.71], we get:\nd\nA   0 [7.72]\n2 3\ndt\nd\nB   0 [7.73]\n3 4\ndt\nB \n  e\ndB   y  [7.74]\n e\ns  D\n \ne 0\n4\ndt e\nWe then calculate:\nA\nA  h [7.75]\n e k' (he)\n1 2\nD\nk' A \nB B \n2 h\n(he) [7.76]\n e  h k' (he)\n1 2\nD\nk' A \n2 h\n  [7.77]\nA\n k' (he)\nk' 31 2 \n D \nand:\nk' A \n2 h\n \nB\n k' (he)\nk' 41 2  [7.78]\n D \n158 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe speed of production of B is obtained from the flux of B at the exit of the\ncrucible:\nB B  k' A \nJ  D\n e  h\n\n2 h\nkA  [7.79]\nB h (he) \n1\nk'\n2\n(he)\n\n h\n D \nWe thus obtain a first order reaction with respect to the reactant, but coefficient k\nis not a factor of speed and therefore the speed does not obey Arrhenius’ law with\nk' (he)\n2\ntemperature. The ratio is called Damkhöler’s number.\nD\nTwo extreme cases of Damkhöler’s number are of interest:\nk' (he)\n– if 2 << 1, the speed becomes:\nD\nB B \nJ  D\n e  h\nk' A kA  [7.80]\nB h he 2 h  h\nCoefficient k is now the rate coefficient of the adsorption step of A.

Figure 7.7 gives the pace of an Arrhenius plot showing the changes between\nthe two cases under the influence of temperature. We say that we have a mode\nchange because the solution for the speed is changed (we do not have a change of\nmechanism, this one is always the same).\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 159\nln v\nE=0\na\nE =E\na 2\n1/T\nFigure 7.7. Change of mode detected on an Arrhenius curve\nin a catalytic reaction\nWe already noted the same phenomenon of a possible change of activation\nenergy according to temperature range in the study of dinitrogen pentoxide\ndecomposition between relations [7.49] and [7.50].\nNOTE 7.6.– Despite the change in activation energy, there is absolutely no\nchange of mechanism in function of temperature in either case. Changes of modes\nvery easily explain disruptions of an Arrhenius line.\n7.5. Pseudo-steady state and open or closed systems\nIn the examples of pseudo-steady state solutions that we have computed above,\nwe have never used the equations of conservation of elements, which means we\nhave never needed to specify whether our calculation was valid in a closed system,\nan open or a partially open system. This comes from the fact that we have only\nestablished speed–concentration relations and have not considered the effect of time.\nIf we wished to integrate the resulting speed expressions, some differences would\nemerge. We should not include a pseudo-steady state condition for an intermediate\nin order to deduce that its concentration (or amount) is constant in closed system.\nSimilarly the integration of the speed equation cannot be performed in closed system\nif we do not know the law of the variation of the concentrations with time.\nThis integration can be performed if the speed–concentration curve is transposed\ninto rate–fractional extent curve.\n7.5.1. Kinetics law in homogeneous closed systems\nWe write the rate as follows:\nvV\nr  [7.82]\nA\n1 0\n160 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n0\nHowever, for ideal mixtures, if v is the molar volume of component A , the\nk k\ntotal volume at time t is:\nV V v 0A  [7.83]\nk k k\nk k\nBy expressing the amounts through [1.15], it becomes:\nV A ( ) v 0 v 0A  [7.84]\n1 0 0 k k k k 0\nk k\nand by incorporating it into [7.79], we obtain:\n \nvA ( ) vk  kA  \n 1 0 0 k 0 0 k 0\ndα  k k \nr   [7.85]\ndt A\n1 0\nhence the volumetric speed:\nA  dα\nv  1 0 [7.86]\nA   ( ) v k  v kA  dt\n1 0 0 k 0 0 k 0\nk k\nMoreover in the second part of the speed–concentration relation, we can replace\neach concentration by using relation [1.30]. We are thus led to a differential\nexpression with a single function: the fractional extent and a variable, whose\nintegration time gives the variation of fractional extent with time. It is then possible\nto return to [1.30] in order to obtain the variation of all the principle components\n(reactants and products).\nTo illustrate this, we apply this method to hydrogen bromide synthesis for which\nthe volumetric speed–concentration relation is relation [7.54], which will be written\nas follows:\n1/2\nkH Br \n2 2\nv [7.87]\n k\"HBr\nk'1 \n Br  \n 2 \nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 161\nLet us assume that at the initial time the fractional extent is zero. There is no\nhydrogen bromide and the reactants are in the stoichiometric proportions. Thus:\nif t =0, 0,   H 2   0    Br 2   0 and   HBr  0 0\nThis is a gas-phase reaction with conservation of the number of moles of gas.\nThe volume therefore remains constant and thus, from [7.82] and [7.87], we obtain:\n1/2\nd V k1Br 2  0 (1)  kV 0 Br 2  1 0 /2 1 5/2 [7.88]\n0\ndt  2k\"  k'  12k\"1 \nk'1 '\n 1\nThis expression can then be integrated, but it is much easier to keep it in the\nderivative form in order to compare it with experimental experience. Moreover\ndigital methods enable us to transform any experimental integral curve into its\nderivative curve. The fitting of this derivative curve with equation [7.8] allows us to\ncalculate the values of the constants k, k’ and k’’. Then it is possible to integrate\nequation [7.8] and knowing (t), calculate the concentrations of each reactant and\nproduct with the following equations:\nHBr  2 Br  Br   Br  1  H \n2 0 2 2 0 2\n7.5.2. Kinetics law in heterogeneous closed systems\nWe replace [7.82] by:\nvS\nr  [7.89]\nA\n1 0\nThe surface variation with reaction speed is then evaluated through a relation of\nthe same type as those encountered in [6.60] and [6.61]. We then find ourselves at\nthe same point as in homogeneous systems.\n162 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFor example, we reconsider the catalytic reaction for which we have the very\nsimple function [7.79]. By taking in account the partial pressure of A in the chamber,\nthis can be written:\nP\nvkA k A [7.90]\n h\nRT\nBy including it in [7.86], we obtain:\ndα kP S kP S\nr   A 0  A 0 kS (1α) [7.91]\ndt RTA\nh\n\n0\nP\nA\n\n0\n0\nwhich through integration gives:\nα 1expkS t [7.92]\n0\n7.5.3. Kinetic laws of open systems with constant concentrations\nIn systems with concentrations that are held constant, the speeds with constant\nspace function – which is the term of product E – are independent of time in\nisothermal conditions. This is true for the volumetric speed of a homogeneous\nsystem as well as for the areal speed of a catalytic system. This will be also true in\nthe case of a strictly heterogeneous reaction that obeys the law of E. Space\nfunctions are, however, frequently a function of time, which leads to absolute speeds\nor to rates that vary with time through this space function.\n7.6. Conclusion\nFinally we see that the real simplification in the resolution of systems is based on\nthe existence of pseudo-steady state modes. It is the latter that enable us to replace\nthe differential equations of intermediate balance with algebraic equations. Hence\nthe interest in experimentally showing the adequacy introduced with experimental\ndata.\nThe notion of quasi-steady state, without being combined to a single and\ninvariant volume, however, provides only little interest in itself in the end because it\nis not equivalent to the pseudo-steady state, which enables the true simplifications.\nPseudo- and Quasi-steady State Modes 163\nWe could have got along very well without the notion of quasi-steady state. We\nhave stated this as the reader might cling to other books relating to kinetics that are\ntoo often, and wrongly, focused on the quasi-steady state, which implies that the\nvolume or surface are invariant. The difference in volume and surface do, however,\nbecome paramount when mainly heterogeneous systems are tackled.\n7.7. Important figure in pseudo-steady state\nMax Bodenstein was the first to introduce the quasi-steady state approximation\nto determine a reaction in view of experimental results.\nMax Bodenstein\n(1871-1942)\nFigure 7.8. Important chemist\n\nChapter 8\nModes with Rate-determining Steps\nWe will devote this chapter to a particular class of pseudo-steady state modes\nthat are known as modes with rate-determining steps in which one or several steps\nwill determine the entire kinetics of a reaction. In other words, these are modes in\nwhich one or several steps have rate coefficients so great that we consider them to be\ninfinite compared with those of the other steps. These other steps will be the rate-\ndetermining steps or determining steps in the context of the pseudo-steady state.\nWhen a single step is determining, we have a pure Besson mode. If two steps are\ndetermining, according to the same author, the mode is known as “mixed”.\nWe may ask where the interest lies in examining pseudo-steady state mode while\nthe treatment of the general pseudo-steady state mode is relatively easy, as we have\nshown through some examples in Chapter 7. In fact this mode is interesting in two\naspects. On one hand, it allows us to sometimes have simpler expressions and yet\nkeep a good agreement with the experiment considering the accuracy of\nmeasurements. On the other hand, such modes are essential in heterogeneous\nkinetics because they are the only ones that lead to kinetics that obey the law of E,\nwhich allows us to establish a parallel with homogeneous reactions. Moreover they\nappear to be sufficient in the vast majority of heterogeneous reactions.\nNOTE 8.1.– It is wrong to talk about slow steps and fast steps or a speed-limiting\nstep instead of a speed-determining step because being in the context of pseudo-\nsteady state, by considering for example relation [7.7] for a linear sequence, all steps\nhave practically the same speed when rounded to a coefficient (the ratio of\nmultiplying coefficients).\n166 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n8.1. Mode with one determining step\n8.1.1. Definition\nOne rate-determining step or “pure” will be called a mode if it satisfies the\nfollowing assumptions:\n– the mode is in the pseudo-steady state;\n– the direct and reverse rate coefficients (and hence the speed factors) of the\ndifferent elementary steps are infinite except for one, whose coefficients are finite\nand which is called the determining step.\n8.1.2. Concentrations theorem for linear sequences\nWe will first state and verify a very important theorem that connects the\nconcentrations of intermediate species to those of the main components of the\nreaction (reactants and products).\nTHEOREM 8.1.– In a mode with one rate-determining step, each intermediate\nspecies is in physico-chemical equilibrium with the main components of the reaction\n(reactants and/or products). Therefore the concentration of each intermediate is\nlinked to the concentrations of some of the main components.\nWe cannot provide general proof of this theorem because there is no general\nlinear mechanism. We shall verify it on a simple linear mechanism, but it is easy to\nprove it in each individual case of linear mechanism.\nLet us consider a simple linear mechanism with consecutive steps named\n[8.R1a], [8.R1b]…, [8.R1…, [8.R1n + 1] of a reaction that produces B from A.\nWe will use speed factorsf ' and f \" for a reaction  and its opposite (see\n \nsection 3.3.2).\nLet us write the reactivity of the the first step of the mechanism by taking into\naccount of the reverse step:\n 1  f 1 '  f 1 \" X 1  1,1  f 1 '\n\n1\nf\n1\n\"\n' X 1  1,1\n\n [8.1]\n f\n1\n\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 167\nIf this reaction is at equilibrium, then we can show that the concentration of X\n1\nis:\n1\n f '  \n  X 1   equ    1 \"   1,1 [8.2]\n f \n1\nhence the reactivity of the the first step:\n \n'    X 1    1,1\n  f 1   [8.3]\n1 1\n\nX \n 1,1\n  1\nequ\n\nLet us examine the th chain reaction, [8.R1 ].

The concentrations of\ni i\nthe reactants and products are not zero (hence the importance of setting the reactant\nand product concentrations of the reaction during experiments), so the speed factors\nf ' and f\" are thus also infinite, whereas for i steps the factorsf ' and f\" have\n  i i\nfinite values.\n(m)\nI\n... ...\n  X   X \ni1,i i1 i,i i\n(j) II\nFigure 8.1. Subsets I and II of the steps surrounding the rate-determining step\nLet us now group together all the steps of the mechanism with infinite\ncoefficients into two subsets (Figure 8.1). Subset I will include all the steps\npreceding step i of finite coefficients; their rank is m, such that: m i. Subset II\nwill include all the steps following step i, and their rank j will be such that: ji.\nLet us first consider subset I. Step [8.R1a] is part of this and its reactivity cannot\nbe infinite (otherwise it would take place instantaneously and X would no longer be\n1\nan intermediate, but almost a reactant). We can therefore see, by looking at\nexpression [8.4], that the only solution in which the reactivity of this step will be\n' ''\nfinite with infinite f and f , is when the term in square brackets is zero. More\n1 1\nformally, we should have:\n1\n '\nf\n  X 1      X 1   equ    1 \"    1,1 [8.8]\n f \n1\nThis means that step [8.R1a] will always be at equilibrium.\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 169\nStep [8.R1b] also belongs to subset I. Let us apply relation [8.6] for\n = 2. By canceling out the square bracket term, we obtain:\n  X 2    2,2     X 1    1,2  \n   1 [8.9]\n  X 1    1,2    X 2   2,2   equ\nhence by using the previous expression:\n \nX   2,2  2   f '   1  f 2 '   2 [8.10]\n2  \"  \"\n f 1   f 2 \nBy going through this reasoning for all of subset I, we obtain:\n\nm  f '  \nX  m,m  m      [8.11]\nm  f \"\n1   \nand we finally reach:\n\ni1 f '  \nX  i1,i1  i1      [8.12]\ni1  f \"\n1   \nThus any intermediate formed by a step belonging to subset I is only expressed\nthrough the ratios of speed factors of pairs of opposite steps. It is therefore in\nequilibrium with the reactants and main products involved in its production step and\nthe steps that precede it.\nLet us now consider subset II and follow the same reasoning as for I, but this\ntime starting from the last step [8.R1n + 1]. For this step, we are led to:\n1\n f \"  \n  X n      X n   equ    f n ' 1   n,n1 [8.13]\n n1\n170 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nBy rolling back step-by-step we obtain:\n\nn1  f \" \nX   j,j1  j1      [8.14]\n j  f ' \nj1   \nand thus we reach:\n\nn1  f \" \nX  i,i1  i1      [8.15]\ni  f ' \ni1   \nEach intermediate of subset II is therefore in equilibrium with the reactants and\nmain products involved in the steps following that of its production, and the theorem\nis verified.\nA consequence of this theorem is that if we work in isothermal conditions and\nthe concentrations of the reactants and products are held constant, the mode is in\nsteady state. In fact, the concentration of each of the intermediates remains constant\nover time because the speed factors are also constant (see Note 3.4).\n8.1.3. Reactivity of the rate-determining step\nIn what follows, will denote the reactivity of a step j in a system\nj,i\ndetermined by step i.\nAs previously, we will reason on the same linear chain.\nAccording to the previous theorem, the reactivity of each step has an\nindeterminate form 0. except that of the determining step i, which is written as\nfollows:\n i  f i ' X i1   i1,i      1  f f i i \" ' X X i     i i ,  i 1,i      [8.16]\ni1\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 171\nBy referring to the concentration expressions [8.12] and [8.15], and by taking\ninto account relations of definitions of multiplying coefficients:\n     and      [8.17]\ni1,i i i1,i1 i1 i,i1 i1 i,i i\nAs all other reactivities are at equilibrium, for the reactivity of step i we obtain:\n   \n \n i   i,i  f i '      i 1 1    f f   \" '      i     1       n 1 1    f f   \" '      i     [8.18]\n \nNOTE 8.2.– It can be seen in the above expression that, if the intensive properties\nof the reaction (temperature and concentrations of reactants and main products) are\nkept constant, the various speed factors are independent of time and, therefore, the\nreactivity remains constant. In pure mode, the reactivity of the rate-determining step\nonly depends on time if the intensive properties vary with time (temperature\nprogramming or closed systems).\n8.1.4. Rate of reaction\nTHEOREM 8.2.– During a mode with one determining step, the rate of the\nreaction is the product of the reactivity of the determining step (the other steps are at\nequilibrium) by the space function relative to the zone where the determining step\ntakes place; this product is weighted by the inverse of the multiplying coefficient of\nthis determining step.\nTo calculate the rate of our reaction, since the mode is in pseudo-steady state,\nrelation [7.13] should be applied by choosing the step that determines the speed to\nbe step i. Therefore we will have:\n\ni,i\nr  E   E [8.19]\ni i i i\n\ni\nIn this expression,  is the reactivity of the determining step. All others are\ni,i\nconsidered to be at equilibrium. E is the space function where the determining step\ni\ntakes place.\n172 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThus, we can write the solution as follows:\nr   E [8.20]\ni i i\n\ni,i\nThis form is thus the product of a reactivity   , which only depends\ni\n\ni\non physico-chemical conditions (such as the reactivity of an elementary step), with a\nspace function that depends only on the nature, shape and size of the zone where the\nelementary determining step takes place.\nThe product of [8.20] enables us to say that, for a linear sequence that occurs in\npure mode determined by one step, the rate is separable.\nThis reactivity  is a volumetric speed in a homogeneous reaction. In the case\ni\nof a heterogeneous reaction, however, it is an areal speed. Despite this, we have kept\nthe name “reactivity” for it because it is often viewed as (if i = 1) a reactivity of an\nelementary step.\nNOTE 8.3.– If the reaction is carried out by keeping all the concentrations of the\nmain components constant and in isothermal conditions, the reactivity  is\n[i]\nindependent of time and the rate (or speed) only depends on time if the space\nfunction depends on it, which means if the corresponding zone has sizes that vary\ndue to the progress of the reaction.\nThus, through this method of the determining process, as many solutions\n(modes) can be obtained as there are steps in the mechanism.\n8.1.5. Calculation of speed of a linear sequence in pure mode determined by one\nstep\n8.1.5.1. Calculation method\nIn light of the above, we can now give a speed calculation method.\nTo apply the method of pure kinetics, we have to:\n– write the mass action law for the equilibriums of the different steps, except for\nthe determining step;\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 173\n– deduce the concentrations of the various intermediates, especially, those that\nare involved in the expression of the reactivity of the determining step, as a function\nof the equilibrium constants of the other steps and concentrations (and/or partial\npressures) of reactants and main products of the overall reaction;\n– include these concentrations in the expression of the reactivity of the\ndetermining step.\nWe finally obtain the reactivity of the determining step as a function of\ntemperature and concentrations (and/or partial pressures) of the main components.\nBy multiplying it by the space function of this determining step and by taking\ninto account its multiplying coefficient, we obtain the rate of the considered\nmode [8.20].\n8.1.5.2. Example of the magnesium oxidation reaction\nLet us reconsider the example discussed in section 6.5 of oxidation [6.R4] of the\nmagnesium plate whose mechanism is given by steps [6.R4a] to [6.R4d]. We have\nseen that the multiplying coefficients are: \n1\n1/2, \n2\n\n3\n\n4\n1 We will\ncalculate the four possible pure modes, which are the solutions when the\ndetermining step is successively [6.R4a], [6.R4b], [6.R4c] and [6.R4d].\nIn our case, the initial solid A is magnesium. Therefore the rate is obtained\nthrough its consumption, which only occurs through step [6.R4d]. The reaction’s\nrate is thus:\nr   E [8.21]\n4 4\nIn order to simplify the calculations and the expressions, we will make the\napproximation that the oxygen vacancies V in magnesium oxide are highly diluted.\nO\nThe equilibrium constants of the different steps (were K 1 because it involves\n3\ndiffusion) are written as follows:\n2\n (1  )\nK  ; K  ; K  V  [8.22]\n1\nP(1  )\n2 2\n V \n4  Oint\n Oext\n174 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe verify that the overall equilibrium has a coefficient K such that:\n1\n n1\n 1/ \n\nK   K .K .K . K . [8.23]\n1 2 4 \nP 0   1  \n8.1.5.2.1.

In order to\nevaluate the indeterminate form, we apply the pseudo-steady state by setting\nrelations [6.34], [6.34], [6.35] to zero and using a null diffusion gradient.

The integration of\nthese speed equations with respect to  leads to linear laws of variation of fractional\nextent with time, except in the case of the mode determined by diffusion [6.R4c],\nwhich leads to the parabolic law:\n2\n k t [8.44]\np\nFinally, a solution corresponding to a pure mode leads to an expression of the\nrate as a function of the partial pressures, concentrations of the main components of\nthe reaction and fractional extent.\n8.1.6. Pure modes away from equilibrium for linear sequences\nWe know that the speed of an elementary step contains the distance term of\nexperimental conditions relative to the equilibrium (relation [3.14]) which for a step\ni is:\nG\n 1exp i [8.45]\ni\nRT\n180 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nHowever, the Gibbs free energy of the reaction is given as a function of the\nGibbs free energies of the elementary steps through:\nG  G [8.46]\n \n\nbut in a mode determined by one step, all the steps other than the one that\ndetermines the speed are assumed at equilibrium and therefore their Gibbs free\nenergy is zero, which leads to:\nG  G [8.47]\ni i,[i]\nThus, for the speed of a reaction determined by step i, the distance between the\nactual conditions and the equilibrium conditions is obtained through:\nG\n 1exp [8.48]\ni\n RT\ni\nThe latter term corresponds to the term in square brackets of relations [8.30],\n[8.32], [8.36] and [8.40].\nIf the experimental conditions are such that we are a long way from equilibrium\nconditions (which means, since all the steps except the determining one are always\nat equilibrium, the determining step is itself far away from equilibrium and its\nopposite reaction speed can therefore be ignored) then the exponential of the\nprevious expression is negligible compared to one.\nEverything goes as if the steps that follow the determining step are no longer\ninvolved. The speed is completely determined by the first i steps. Thus the partial\npressure or concentration of a main component of the reaction will only affect the\nspeed if that constituent is involved in the steps that precede the step that determines\nthe speed.\n8.1.7. Influence of temperature on linear sequences\nAs for the influence of temperature, by deriving the rate, with constant space\nfunction, we can write:\nlnr ln\ni i\n [8.49]\n(1/T) (1/T)\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 181\nLet us reconsider the example of relation [8.40]:\n  0 \n '  P \nlnk 4 1  \nln r4\n\nlnφ4\n\n    P    \n\nln  k 4 ' ε 4  [8.50]\n(1/T) (1/T) (1/T) (1/T)\nThis relation is not a simple equation. Let us look at the ratio of the reactivity to\nthe distance between the actual conditions and the equilibrium conditions. Equation\n[8.50] becomes:\n  \n4\nln  [8.51]\n   '\n 4 \n\ndlnk 4\n(1/T) d(1/T)\nhowever, it is known that the rate coefficient k' follows Arrhenius’ law, so we\n4\ndeduce:\n \n4\nln \n   4  \n\ndln  k ' 4 \n\nE a  4\n[8.52]\n(1/T) d(1/T) R\nThus we realize that the ratio of the reactivity to the distance between the actual\nconditions and the equilibrium conditions follows Arrhenius’ law with a temperature\ncoefficient that is an apparent activation energy and, in the case of the example\nchosen, is the activation energy of the rate-determining step. We will see, in other\nexamples, that this is not always the case. Table 8.2 summarizes Arrhenius’\ntemperature coefficient (or apparent activation energy), when it exists, as a function\nof the activation energies and enthalpies of the elementary steps.\nIt should be noted that a diffusion step occurs with a null enthalpy. The sign of\nthe apparent activation energy, if it exists, unlike the sign of a real activation energy,\nis not necessarily positive due to possible negative enthalpic terms, i.e. due to the\npresence of highly exothermic steps that precede the determining step.\n182 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nNOTE 8.4.– We see that the influence of temperature can be complex and that a\nsimilar calculation should be performed for each mechanism studied. In particular, it\nshould be noted that the second solution corresponding to the second mode does not\nenable us to separate the variables of pressure and temperature.\nSpeed-\ndetermining Arrhenius coefficient\nstep\nExists only if K K 1 then   E  or\n2 4 a a1\n[6.R3a]\nK K 1 then   E   2H  2H\n2 4 a a 1 2 4\nExists only if:\nKP1 then   (E ) H\n[6.R3b] 1 a a 2 4\nH\nor KP1 then   (E ) H  4\n1 a a 2 4 2\n[6.R3c]  a  (E a ) 3 H 4\n[6.R3d]  a  (E a ) 4\nTable 8.2. Arrhenius coefficients of the different modes\ndetermined by a step in magnesium oxidation\n8.1.8. Cyclic sequences\nUntil now, we have chosen the rate-determining step in a linear sequence. Let us\nnow examine the case where the determining step is chosen within a loop.\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 183\nFigure 8.2 represents a step that enables us to go from intermediate X to X in\ni i + 1\nthe loop of a Semenov diagram. If this step determines the speed, which means that\nall the others are practically at equilibrium, then species X and X are in\ni i + 1\nequilibrium with the other side of the loop, regardless of its direction of traversal.\nTherefore, the speed of the determining step will be zero because it is the product of\na finite rate with null distance between the actual conditions and the equilibrium\nconditions.\nIt follows that it is impossible to envisage a mode with a rate-determining step if\nthis step is placed inside a loop because the reaction would be instantaneous.\nX\ni\nX+…→X +…\ni i+1\nX\ni+1\nFigure 8.2. Determining step inserted in a loop\n8.1.9. Conclusion on modes with a single determining step\nFrom our study of pseudo-steady state modes whose speed is determined by a\nsingle step, we can draw the following conclusions:\n– A pseudo-steady state solution determined by a single step is only conceivable\nfor the steps taken outside of a Semenov cycle diagram.\n– In practice, in order to seek a solution related to a determining step, we just\nhave to perform the speed calculation by considering the direct reaction of the rate-\ndetermining step and, if it is not negligible, add the distance term between the actual\nconditions and the equilibrium conditions obtained from relation [8.47] by taking\ninto account the multiplying coefficient of the step. It is useful to make the Gibbs\nfree energy explicit in terms of concentrations and temperature.\n184 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe review of many general results enables us to deduce the following properties\nof modes with one rate-determining step that are important in the choice of\nmechanism:\n– The resulting rate is always separable and the space function only depends on\nthe size of the zone where the determining step takes place. Thus, steps [6.R4a] and\n[6.R4b] occur in zones that always maintain identical sizes and so the space function\nis the same for these two steps.\n– We see that if the rate-determining step does not belong to a catalytic cycle,\nwhich means that it does not involve species whose concentrations are\ncomplementary (constant sum – step [6.R4c] and [6.R4b] in the previous example),\nthe mode of the determining step enables us to reach a solution in which the ratio of\nthe reactivity to distance between the actual conditions and the equilibrium\nconditions is a function in which the concentration variables are separated from each\nother and from the temperature. In this function only the concentrations of the\nreactants and products used in the first members of the determining step and steps\nthat precede the determining step in the mechanism are involved. This function\nobeys Arrhenius’ law and its temperature coefficient, which is an apparent activation\nenergy, is the sum of the activation energy of the determining step and the enthalpies\nof the steps that precede it, each multiplied by its multiplying coefficient.\nWe deduce from these observations that a speed that obeys an order with respect\nto a reactant can be explained if the following conditions are met:\n– the reaction is carried out under conditions that are a long way from\nequilibrium;\n– the determining step does not belong to a catalytic cycle;\n– this step, or at least one of those that precedes it in the mechanism, involves\nthat reactant.\nLikewise, the speed obeys Arrhenius’ law and the temperature coefficient is an\napparent activation energy if the following conditions are met:\n– the reaction is carried out under conditions that are a long way from\nequilibrium;\n– the determining step does not belong to a catalytic cycle.\nFurthermore, this apparent energy is only a true activation energy if no step\nprecedes the rate-determining step in the mechanism.\nFor example, we see that in the magnesium oxidation reaction, the reactivity is a\nfunction in which the temperature is a separate variable only if the steps [6.R4c] or\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 185\n[6.R4d] are determining (steps [6.R4a] and [6.R4b] belong to a catalytic cycle with\nthe sum of the concentrations of empty and occupied sites, which is constant). These\nsteps are of zero order with respect to the gas because the chain of the mechanism,\nwhich is a convergent linear mechanism, has a branch that starts in [6.R4d] and then\n[6.R4c] and neither of these steps reacts with oxygen. They both lead to apparent\nactivation energies but only the mode determined by step [6.R4d] gives a true\nactivation energy because this step is not preceded by any other in the chain.\n8.2. Pseudo-steady state mode with two determining steps\n8.2.1. Definition\nA pseudo-steady state mode is said to have two rate-determining steps or be in\nthe mixed pseudo-steady state if it meets the following assumptions:\n– the mode is in the pseudo-steady state;\n– the rate coefficients (and hence the speed factors) of the different elementary\nsteps are infinite except for two of them whose coefficients are finite and are called\nthe rate-determining steps.\n8.2.2. Mathematical formulation of a mixed pseudo-steady state mode\nThe simplest method for the mathematical formulation of such a mode is the\nfollowing and it is based on the one that has been used for pure modes with a single\nrate-determining step.\nFirst, we write the mass action law for all the non-determining steps and we\ndeduce the concentrations of all the intermediates except one: the one that is\ninvolved in both determining steps.\nNOTE 8.5.– If the two chosen steps are not immediately consecutive, we obtain a\nrelation between the concentrations of the intermediate produced by the first and the\nintermediate for the second through the equilibria of the intermediate steps by\napplying the mass action law to the steps located between the two determining steps.\nThen we write two equations, by applying [8.19], each expressing that the rate is\ngiven by the rates of each of the determining steps. We replace there the\nconcentrations calculated earlier. This gives a system of two equations with two\nunknowns, which are the rate of the system and the unknown concentration of the\nintermediate. The resolution of this system enables us to determine the rate as a\nfunction of concentrations, temperature (through the rate coefficients of both non-\n186 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\ndetermining steps and the equilibrium constants of the others) and morphological\ndata in the zones where the determining steps take place.\nWe will apply the method to such a mode in the case of magnesium oxidation\n[6.R4] with the magnesium sample plane whose mechanism is given by steps\n[6.R4a] to [6.R4b]. We will choose the mixed mode determined by the outer\ninterface reaction [6.R4b] and diffusion [6.R4c].\nBy using the first and third equation in [8.22], the equilibria of steps [6.R4a] and\n[6.R4d], we calculate:\nK P\n1\n and [V ] K [8.53]\nO int 4\n1 K P\n1\nWe can express the system rate r in two different ways by applying relation\n[2,3]\n[7.15] to each of the determining steps [6.R4b] and [6.R4c]. Therefore we will have:\nk' K P k\" \nr 2.3  2 E 2   1 2 K 1 1 P V O  ext  1 K 2 1 P   E 2 [8.54]\nr  E   DK DV   E [8.55]\n2,3 3 3 4 O ext 3\nThe system consisting of equations [8.54] and [8.55] has two unknowns: the rate\nr and the outer concentration in oxygen vacancies. The resolution of this system\ngives the solution to the corresponding mixed mode.\n8.2.3. Linear sequences: inverse rate law or the law of slowness\nThrough the addition of [8.54] and [8.55], after having multiplied the first by\nk' K P\n2 1\nK DE and the second by E , we cancel the concentration in outer\n4 3 2\n1 K P\n1\noxygen vacancies and we obtain:\n1 1 1\n \nr k 2 ' 1 K K 1 P 1 P K 4      1  P P 0     2V m e (Mg) DzK 4     1- P P 0    4V z m e ( 2 M  g)\n \n[8.56]\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 187\nIf we compare the latter relation with the expressions of the second and third row\nof Table 8.1, we can see that the following result is obtained:\n1 1 1 1 1\n    [8.57]\nr r r  E  E\n2,3 2 3 [2] 2 [3] 3\nThe inverse of the rate in a mixed pseudo-steady state mode is the sum of the\ninverse rates of both pure modes corresponding to the two determining steps. This\ntheorem constitutes what is called the inverse rate law.\nIt is proved and we assume that this theorem is general for the mixed pseudo-\nsteady state modes of a linear sequence, even if the two determining steps are not\nimmediately consecutive, as in the previous example, provided that both\ndetermining steps have the same multiplying coefficient. If the latter condition is not\nmet, relation [8.57] is not usable.\nWe cannot take a determining step in a loop and one outside the loop, but it is\npossible to have a loop between the two rate-determining steps, like in the scheme\nbelow.\n1st determining step\n2nd determining step\nNOTE 8.6.– This theorem, which has often been viewed as an inverse (or\nconductance) addition law for series reactions (by analogy to the electrical\nconductances), is not one of them. This is because the addition does not concern the\nrates of the inverses of both determining steps (which are equal), but the solutions of\nthe modes with one determining step.\n188 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nNOTE 8.7.– We can write relation [8.57] as follows:\n  E E\n2[2] 3[3] 2 3\nr  [8.58]\n E  E\n2[2] 2 3[3] 3\nThis relation shows that in general the mixed pseudo-steady state mode does not\nfollow the law of E, except when both determining steps have the same space\nfunction. In this case the reactivities follow the inverse rate law.\nIf the two determining steps do not have the same multiplying coefficient, the\nsystem of the two equations is less straightforward and does not allow elimination of\nthe concentration by simple addition. Therefore, the inverse rate law is no longer\nmet.\nThe solution is thus obtained with steps close to equilibrium. If the overall\nreaction is carried out a long way from equilibrium conditions, this does not mean\nthat each of the rate-determining steps is also distant from equilibrium. In order to\navoid mistakes, we lead the calculations in the general case with the actual\nconditions not far from the equilibrium conditions and we apply the approximation\n0\nonly on the final result. For example in relation [6.55] we will ignore P /P\ncompared with 1.\n8.2.4. Cyclic sequences\nIn the case of a loop, two cases arise:\n– both determining steps belong to the same branch of the loop, but the\nequilibrium between all the species due to the other branch of the loop and the\nreaction is instantaneous; or\n– each of the determining steps belongs to one branch of the loop and, in this\ncase, a simple rate addition law is obtained. To sum up, whenever at least one of the\ndetermining steps belongs to a loop or a set of parallel paths, the application of the\ninverse rates law will be avoided.\n8.2.5. Law of characteristic times\nLet  denote the time needed for the fractional extent to go from zero to a value\n, which represents a variation  in a mixed pseudo-steady state mode of a linear\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 189\nsequence and let [i] and [j] denote the time needed to obtain the same fractional\nextent of variation  in a pure mode of i and j, respectively. If t is not too large,\nby using [8.57] we can write:\n \n1 t 1 1 i i\n     [8.59]\nr  r r  \ni,j [i] [j]\nfrom which we deduce:\n   [8.60]\ni,j i j\nThis law is called the law of addition of characteristic times. It is applied under\nthe same conditions as the inverse rates law from which it is directly derived and is\nrecalled in the following:\n– pseudo-steady state mode;\n– linear sequence;\n– the same multiplying coefficients for all the determining steps.\n8.3. Generalization to more than two determining steps\nIt is easily conceivable that choosing three, four, or more determining steps and,\nultimately, taking all the steps as determining can complicate the mode. We then\nobtain the general pseudo-steady state mode.\nThe previous generalization leads to a generalization of the inverse rates law in\nthe case of linear sequences and with the condition that all the steps involved have\nthe same multiplying coefficient. Thus we have:\n   \n1 1 1\n   [8.61]\nr r   E \ni  i  i i \nThis generalized inverse rates law only leads to a form E if all the space\nfunctions are identical, as is the case in a homogeneous system.\nSimilarly, a generalized law of the addition of characteristic times would be\nobtained.\n190 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n8.4. Conclusion to the study of modes with one or several rate-determining\nsteps\nWe deduce from the systematic review of many cases and assume an extremely\nimportant property of modes with one or several determining steps and other modes,\nthat a reaction rate is expressed as a product of two functions:\n–  which only depends on intensive physico-chemical variables; and\n– E, which only depends on the textural characteristics of reaction zones.\nThis is the case only for modes belonging to the following families:\n– modes with one rate-determining step; and\n– modes with several rate-determining steps and more generally all pseudo-\nsteady state modes, with the condition that the space functions of all the steps are\nidentical.\nThis property, which is sometimes known as the law of E, is extremely useful\nin heterogeneous kinetics because the experimental verification of this property,\nwhich is very common, greatly simplifies the research into mechanisms.\nThis property applies to all homogeneous systems in pseudo-steady state modes.\nHere, the function  is the volumetric speed and the unique space function is the\nratio of the phase volume to the amount of reference substance chosen.\n8.5. First order mode changes\nLet us reconsider Table 8.1 and imagine that in a certain range of temperatures\nstep 3 of diffusion is determining, and in the following temperature range – due to a\ndifferent action of temperature on the rate coefficients – step 2 of the outer interface\nreaction becomes determining. In each of the temperature ranges we will therefore\nobtain two kinetic laws versus time. If we look at Table 8.2, we will probably have a\ndifferent temperature coefficient for each range. This is what is called a first order\nchange of mode.\nThis change results in a break in the Arrhenius line. This is what we have already\nseen in the example of N O decomposition (see section 7.4.2) and in the catalysis\n2 5\nexample (section 7.4.5 and Figure 7.7), in which the resulting two extreme cases\nwere the two modes with a single determining step.\nThe space between the two modes with one determining step is the\ncorresponding mode with two determining steps.\nModes with Rate-determining Steps 191\nThis phenomenon is particularly expanded in the oxidation reaction of a sheet of\ntantalum by oxygen gas, for which with the increase in temperature we pass from an\ninverse logarithmic-type law of extent as a function of time to a logarithmic law,\nthen a cubic law, parabolic law, and finally a linear law at the highest temperatures.\n8.6. Conclusion\nPseudo-steady state modes with rate-determining steps are specifically useful in\nheterogeneous kinetics for which we see that a very broad majority of reactions are\nadequately represented. They lead to simple expressions of speed that often admit an\norder with respect to some reactants.\n\nPART 2\nReaction Mechanisms\nand Kinetic Properties\n\nChapter 9\nEstablishment and Resolution\nof a Reaction Mechanism\nIt is known that most chemical reactions do not occur in a single step but are the\nresult of combinations of simpler reactions called “elementary steps”. In a reaction,\nall these elementary steps combine to produce its overall reaction mechanism.\n9.1. Families of reaction mechanisms\nThere are two large families of reactions.\n– Reactions with a unique sequence limited to a few elementary steps.\n– Reactions with an infinite number of elementary steps, which include two\ndistinct families:\n- chain reactions in which, in addition to a number of single-sequence steps\n(initiations and terminations), a small number of steps (the link) are repeated a\ntheoretically infinite number of times;\n- reactions producing macromolecules in which each step periodically\nincreases a pattern that is the length of a molecule with a periodic pattern.\nIt is extremely difficult to prove the elementary status of a reaction. Knowing\nexamples and following some principles allows us to appreciate the elementary\nstatus of a reaction.\n196 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n9.2. Different categories of elementary steps\nThere are numerous types of elementary reactions involving the use of different\ntypes of reaction intermediates.\nWith regard to the type of reaction zone, we can distinguish volume reactions\nthat occur in a certain volume and interface reactions that take place at the interface\nbetween two phases: solid–gas, solid–solid, solid–liquid or liquid–gas.\nReactions are classified according to the type of intermediate processes involved\nand the nature of the chemical bond altered during the elementary step. As we shall\nsee in section 9.3.3, an elementary step only involves the modification of a single\nbond.\n9.2.1. Homolytic bond breaking\nIn this type of breaking, two parts of the molecule take an electron away from\nthe electron pair, which leads to the formation of two radicals, such as for example\nthe dissociation of bromine during the first step of hydrogen bromide synthesis:\nBr:Br → Br + Br [9.R1]\n° °\n9.2.2. Heterolytic bond breaking\nIn such breaking, one side of the molecule takes both electrons away from the\nelectron pair. This leads to the formation of both positive and negative ions on two\nparts of the molecule. This can be seen, for example, during the breaking of\norganometallic compounds such as organomagnesium:\nCH :MgBr → CH -Mg+ + Br- [9.R2]\n3 3\n9.2.3. Ion dissociation\nWhen ions are formed, these may have an internal energy that is higher than the\nenergy required to induce fragmentation, thus leading to dissociation reactions such\nas:\n[(CH ) CHCHCH )+]* → (C H )+ + C H [9.R3]\n3 2 3 3 7 2 4\nReaction Mechanism 197\nThis is in fact a type of homolytic ion dissociation that is classified separately\nbecause, unlike the homolytic breaking previously shown, this dissociation does not\noriginate from molecules.\n9.2.4. Radical reactions\nThis combination involves the addition of reacting radicals, such as for example\nbetween two ethyl radicals to give n-butane:\nC H . + C H . → n-C H [9.R4]\n2 5 2 5 4 10\nRadical–radical reactions are simply the “marriage” of two unpaired electrons by\nanti-parallel spin coupling; they therefore need little or no activation energy but are\nhighly exothermic. With the exception of a few cases, radical–radical reactions are\nmore likely than radical–molecule reactions, provided the radical concentrations are\nsuitable.\nThe majority of radicals reacting with each other form what is called\ncombination products, whereas a minority form dismutation (disproportionation)\nproducts.\nThere is, however, an example where radicals do not react with each other when\nradical concentrations are extremely low. The radicals then have the opportunity to\nsurvive long enough to diffuse up to the walls of the reactor, where they are either\nadsorbed or recombine due to their proximate high concentration.\n9.2.5. Ion–molecule reactions\nThe electrical influence of an ion disturbs the charge distribution inside a\nmolecule, which is even more prevalent with electron bonds. This electric\npolarization effect will give specific properties to the ion when attacking a molecule,\nwhich will not require a thermal energy bigger than the average surrounding\nmolecule to react. This interaction may result in different effects.\n9.2.5.1. Ion–molecule reactions with charge transfer\nIn this case, the charge of the ion is transferred to the molecule. These are\nreactions of the following type:\nRH + + R'H → RH + R'H + [9.R5]\n2 2 2 2\nThese reactions are very efficient and generally have no parallel reaction.\n198 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n9.2.5.2. Ion–molecule reactions with proton transfer\nIn these reactions, the ion loses a proton to the molecule. The proton affinity\n(AP) of a neutral molecule M is defined as being equal to the enthalpy (except for\nthe sign) of the reaction:\nM + H+ → MH+; - H = A.P.(M) [9.R6]\nor:\nA.P.(M) = H(M) + H(H+)  H(MH+)\nf f f\nNOTE 9.1.– The proton affinity of M is therefore the opposite to the enthalpy of\nthe reaction of the MH+ species formation. If we consider the following equilibrium:\nM\n1\nH+ + M\n2\n= M\n1\n+ M\n2\nH+ [9.R7]\nthis equilibrium will shift so that the reaction is exothermic. In other words, the\nproton moves towards the entity with the highest proton affinity.\nThese reactions are also very effective and it can be said that virtually every\nclash leads to a proton transfer.\n9.2.5.3. Ion–molecule reactions with negative ion transfers\nVarious types of negative ion transfers have been observed in the gas phase as\nwell as in the condensed phase. For example, the transfer of the H+ ion is a fast\nprocess, provided that the reaction is exothermic:\nC\nn\nH\n2\n\nn1\n RH  C\nn\nH\n2n2\n R [9.R8]\nThese reactions are also very effective and can occur at virtually every clash.\n9.2.5.4. Ion–molecule reactions with condensation\nCondensation reactions are also possible with ions. Ionic polymerization is a\ncommon example:\nC H  C H  C H [9.R9]\n2 4 2 4 4 8\nIn some cases the reaction is accompanied by the elimination of an electron or a\nsmall molecule:\nC H  C H  C H  H [9.R10]\n2 5 2 6 4 9 2\nReaction Mechanism 199\n9.2.6. Reactions between ions\nWe must distinguish reactions between ions of the same sign, such as the\ndismutation of the hypochlorite ion according to:\nClO  ClO  ClO  Cl [9.R11]\n2\nThese reactions generally have very high activation energy.\nThe reactions between ions of opposite signs have a priori very low activation\nenergy, such as the reaction between the iron (II) and chromium (VI) ions:\nFe2+ + Cr O H- → 2CrO - + H O + Fe3+ [9.R12]\n2 7 2 2\nThis reaction is a step in the oxidation of iron (II) into iron (III) by chromium\n(VI). In the mechanism, the chromium goes through all its levels of oxidation.\n9.2.7. Interface reactions\nIn heterogeneous systems, particularly those involving a solid phase, reactions\nhappen at the interface between the gaseous medium and the solid phase. The most\nimportant are those involving adsorption. When gas is in the presence of a solid,\nsome of its molecules bind to the solid surface. These bonds can sometimes be of\ncomparable force to covalent bonds. This is described as the process of\nchemisorption, where the gaseous molecules linked to the solid are called adsorbed\nmolecules.\n9.2.7.1. Simple adsorption\nIf s denotes a site on the surface of the solid that can fix a gas molecule, the\nadsorption step is often considered elementary and for a gas G is written:\nG + s → G-s [9.R13]\n9.2.7.2. Dissociative adsorption\nIn some cases the distance between two sites on which two parts of a molecule\nare linked is such that true dissociation of the gaseous molecule occurs during the\nadsorption. In the hypothesis of identical sites for both fractions, this can be written:\nG + 2s → 2G-s [9.R14]\n2\n200 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n9.2.7.3. Reactions between adsorbed species or adsorbed species and molecules\nIn heterogeneous catalysis, two types of reactions involving the absorbed\nmolecules are possible, which result in two distinct families of mechanisms. Either\nthe reactions between adsorbed molecules give rise to a new absorbed molecule,\nsuch as:\nCO-s + H -s → C + H O-s + s [9.R15]\n2 2\nor, the reaction between an absorbed molecule and a gas molecule gives rise to a\nnew absorbed molecule, such as:\nH-s + D → HD -s [9.R16]\n2 2\nReactions such as [9.R15] are characteristic of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood\ncatalysis mechanism (see section 13.2.3.2.1). Reactions such as [9.R16] are\ncharacteristic of the Rideal–Riley mechanism (see section 13.2.3.2.2).\n9.2.8. Reaction between structure elements in the solid state\nThis reaction produces or consumes vacancies or ions within the interstitial\nposition at the interface between a solid phase and another solid or gaseous phase,\nsuch as those found at an oxide–metal interface during the oxidation of zinc by\noxygen. This can be written using Kröger’s notation (see Appendix 1):\nZnV i Zn i  e'V m [9.R17]\n9.2.9. Reactions between adsorbed species and point defects\nIn heterogeneous reactions involving a stoichiometric solid, defects of the solid\ncan react with adsorbed species. Hence the oxidation of zinc by oxygen, in which a\nreaction between adsorbed oxygen and zinc cations at the interstitial position leads\nto the growth of the zinc oxide network at the surface of the zinc oxide solid. This\ncan be written using Kröger’s notation (see Appendix 1):\nOsZn i  e' Zn Zn O O s [9.R18]\nThe wide variety of elementary reactions hitherto examined is far from covering\nall possible stages. Insufficient experimental data often result in researchers settling\nfor hypotheses that are compatible with the overall process of the reaction. Often,\nReaction Mechanism 201\nthe proposed mechanism is a possible mechanism; others are also likely, but the\nadoption of a new mechanism can only result from new experimental data.\nA step during which two intermediates react with each other is sometimes called\na quadratic step.\n9.3. Establishment of a reaction mechanism\nThere is no foolproof and generic methodology that allows us to find the\nmechanism of a reaction. We therefore take an intuitive approach. Some rules must\nbe respected, however. For writing the process itself, we generally use personal\nknowledge about a number of already known mechanisms, and therefore the more\nthe researcher knows, the more likely he or she will be effective. A number of\ncommon mechanisms generic to an entire family of reactions are often good starting\npoints. There are many examples of such generic mechanisms. One is the Rice–\nHerzfeld mechanism, which is used to account for the decomposition of saturated\nhydrocarbons. It is generally accepted as following a chain of radical mechanisms.\nThis includes the three classic phases of chain reactions:\n– Initiation: free radicals are initiated by rupture of the molecule at its weakest\nbond.\n– Chain propagation takes place in two phases:\n- one of the radicals extracts one hydrogen atom from the initial hydrocarbon\nto form a small molecule and a new radical; the two families of radicals formed can\nin turn react the same way,\n- free radicals of the type R-CH -CH ° can be stabilized by ethylene\n3 2\nelimination, such as:\nR-CH -CH ° → RH + CH =CH\n3 2 2 2\n– Termination: chain termination happens by radical combination.\nThis type of reaction mechanism applied to different saturated hydrocarbons\nhighlights the extraordinary complexity of the distribution of products formed\nduring numerous pyrolyses.\n9.3.1. Methodology\nWe use the trial and error method, which is a permanent back-and-forth between\nwriting the mechanism and carrying out experiments to validate it.\n202 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFirst, we must propose a possible mechanism satisfying a certain number of rules\n(five in total, see sections 9.3.2 to 9.3.6). Once the mechanism hypothesis is\nproposed, all the consequences including kinetics are drawn. Thereafter, we can\ncome up with complementary experiments to prove the mechanism incorrect. A\nmechanism can never be proved correct. We can only prove the opposite, hence\ndiscarding a mechanism that would not be consistent with observations.\nIt follows from this that the conclusion always leads to the availability of a\nmechanism accounting for known facts, but others may exist and therefore “a”\nmechanism and not “the” mechanism of the reaction is identified. Sometimes, we\ncan suggest several mechanisms that are compatible with all of the experimental\nobservations. New experiments or methods of investigation must be set up to decide\nbetween these mechanisms. However, even if only one mechanism is compatible\nwith all experimental data, it should always be considered a hypothesis.\n9.3.2. Rule no. 1: the law of elimination of intermediates\nFor elementary steps, it is possible to write a balanced equation. Any\nintermediary must be produced and consumed during the overall mechanism, so\nthere will be one or more combinations of elementary steps leading to the final\nbalanced equation by eliminating all of the intermediates (sometimes this result is\ncalled the law of elimination of intermediates). To perform this combination, it is\nsometimes necessary to multiply some of the elementary steps by coefficients.\nRemember that these act as the multiplying coefficient of the step.\nA review of the different reaction schemes is given in the following subsections.\n9.3.2.1. Open sequences\nIn this case, a linear combination of the elementary steps must eliminate the\nintermediary species. In other words, for a main reactant of reaction k (reactant or\nproduct) involved in step  with the algebraic stoichiometric coefficient , the\nk\nfollowing relationship can be written:\n  0\n k,\n[9.1]\n\n9.3.2.2. Case of single looped sequences\nThis is a case where two linear combinations pass either side of the loop (in the\ncorrect direction).\nReaction Mechanism 203\n9.3.2.3. Case of chain reactions\nIn this case, the linear combination must involve the link of the chain as well as\nat least one of the initiation and rupture steps. In the case of several parallel rupture\nsteps, each step enters a different linear combination.\nMoreover, in a chain reaction, the propagation steps must obey the elimination\nof intermediates rule by repeating them an infinite number of times. This is called\nthe alternation of steps of the chain link.\nNOTE 9.2.– As the stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced equation are only\ndefined to the nearest coefficient, which is not the case with elementary steps, there\nare an infinite number of coefficient sets for a reaction, all of which are in\nproportion to each other. This is what is chosen when writing the overall equation\nthat sets the range of coefficients chosen.\n9.3.3. Rule no. 2: the rule of the least change of structure (in the case of a single\nbond)\nAn elementary reaction must only modify a small number of covalent or dative\nbonds, as the probability of several bonds rupturing simultaneously is extremely\nlow, especially in the case of very high-energy bonds. To break several bonds,\nsuitable levels of energies are required to spread within the molecule in given\ndirections, which is very unlikely.\nFor example, during the combustion of propane:\nC H + 5O = 3CO + 4H O [9.R19]\n3 8 2 2 2\nit is necessary to break three carbon–carbon and eight carbon–hydrogen bonds. To\nimagine a simultaneous rupture of all these bonds would be contrary to common\nsense.\nThis rule does not apply to ionic bonds, which are distant and not oriented. The\ndisplacement of an ion can lead to the deep mutation of several bonds.\n9.3.4. Rule no. 3: the rule of the greatest simplicity of elementary reactions\n(bimolecular)\nThis principle, which is applied within fluid, gaseous and liquid phases, comes\nfrom the commonly agreed fact that for one elementary reaction to happen,\nmolecules must “meet” – at least in the energetic sense of the word. This means that\n204 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nthey must come into close contact with each other. Moreover, the collision of two\nparticles is much more likely than the simultaneous collision of three particles. We\nwill accept as a general rule that elementary reactions involve only two molecules,\nalso called bimolecular reactions.\nReturning to the previous example of propane combustion, a single-step reaction\nwould require collisions between six non-random molecules, which is highly\nunlikely and would result in a very low reaction rate in reality.\n9.3.5. Rule no. 4: the rule involving a single jump into the solid state\nThis rule is the same as the previous one for the solid state. We will see that the\nelementary act during solid state reactions is the activated jump of a particle from a\ndeparture to an arrival site. A reaction involving the simultaneous jump of several\nparticles or multiple jumps of the same particle would be very unlikely.\nTranscribed as a quasi-chemical reaction using Kröger’s notations, one jump can\nlead to the reactant stoichiometric coefficients, with a high sum greater than two.\nWe must remember that in the solid state, these coefficients have no relationship\nwith the number of particles involved in single collision, as in the fluid phase. For\nexample, reaction [9.R14] only requires the two necessary sites to be adjacent at the\nsurface of the solid.\n9.3.6. Rule no. 5: the law of micro-reversibility\nThis is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. The development of\na reaction must in some way follow the same mechanical pathway as the reverse\nreaction.\nThis principle, which must be respected at the scale of an elementary step, is not\nvalid when considering the overall reaction, as shown in the example of calcium\ncarbonate decomposition:\nCaCO = CO + CaO [9.R20]\n3 2\nIn this decomposition reaction, it is evident that the lime formed will be on the\nsurface of the carbonate grains (between the carbonate and the gas), whereas in the\nreverse reaction the carbonate would be on the surface of the lime (between the lime\nand the gas). In the first case, carbon dioxide has to go through the lime, whereas in\nthe second case, it has to go through the carbonate. These paths are not the reverse\nReaction Mechanism 205\nof each other, but this does not contradict the principle of micro-reversibility\nbecause reaction [9.R20] is not elementary.\n9.4. Research into a mechanism: intermediary reactions\nIf a mechanism includes several steps, this means that it involves relatively\nstable intermediary compounds, which can be classified in two large families based\non their relative duration of existence:\n– intermediates with long lifetimes that will eventually be detected by classic\nanalytical methods, as if they were stable, final products of reactions;\n– intermediates with short lifetimes for which additional experiments – often\nsophisticated – are necessary for detection.\n9.4.1. Reaction filiations: primary and non-primary products\nAs well as the reactants, several products can simultaneously be present with\nrelative stability, even if these are no longer present in the reaction. These products\nare known as intermediates with a long lifetime. The research into reaction filiations\nis the first step in a kinetic study because it allows us to define chemical reactions\nthat actually happen in a medium while producing long lifetime intermediates.\n9.4.1.1. Filiation schemes\nIf several products are present at a sensible level in a medium, and some are\n“stable” intermediates that will no longer be present at the end of the reaction, it is\nimportant to build-up the filiations of different products. We need to know each of\ntheir immediate precursors. To achieve this, we must proceed in two steps. In the\nfirst instance, we must consider the possible filiations that are reactions. If some can\nbe achieved on their own, we will analyze them separately to check them. In the\nsecond instance, we must try to distinguish primary and non-primary products.\n9.4.1.2. Primary and non-primary products\nIt is important to know the order in which these intermediates appear as well as\ntheir filiations. We must distinguish the primary products directly resulting from\nreactants from the non-primary products that result directly or non-directly from the\nprimary products.\nTo illustrate this, consider the simple reaction as shown in Figure 9.1 in which\nonly one reactant, A, is included and gives two stable products, D and E.\n206 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nCompounds B and C are the primary products, whereas D, E and F are the\nsecondary products.\n(3)\nB D\n(1)\nA\n(2)\n(4) (5)\nC E F\nFigure 9.1. Reaction scheme with primary and non-primary products\nWith homogeneous kinetics, the initial reaction rates allow us to distinguish the\nprimary products – whose initial rate of formation is finite and not zero – from the\nnon-primary products – whose initial speeds of formation are zero and the\nprecursors are not present in the initial medium. This rule is no longer true with\nheterogeneous kinetics, including the formation of new solid phases, since the\ncompetitive nucleation-growth reactions (see Chapter 14) have an initial rate of zero,\neven for primary products.\n9.4.1.3. Experimental determination of the primary or non-primary character of a\nproduct\nWe have seen that the initial rates are not always reliable, even in the case of\nhomogeneous kinetics with low initial rates. To establish the primary or secondary\nnature of a mixture of reaction products, the “horizontal diagram” is used.\nConsider the evolution curves of the five products from the previous reaction as\na function of time (see Figure 9.2a). The percentage of each of product present in the\nmedium is normalized to 100 by products, not reactants, and at a given time t , must\n1\nbe taken into account. Percentages are recorded as a function of time on a graph\n(Figure 9.2b). This is repeated for different times: t , t …, which gives rise to the\n2 3\ncurves in Figure 9.2b. At the first time, t , the primary products are the only ones\n1\npresent in the medium and correlate with a high proportion of the non-primary\nproducts.\nLet us see the example of the reduction of uranyl fluoride by pyrolysis during\nwhich the uranyl fluoride is heated in the presence of both water and hydrogen\nReaction Mechanism 207\nvapors. Two uranium oxides, UO and UO are present in the reaction medium. It\n2 3,\nwould take a long time to determine whether the final product is UO or UO .\n2 3\nFigure 9.2. Construction of the horizontal diagram\nTwo filiations are possible. The first in which UO is the intermediary:\n3\nUO F +H O=UO +2HF\n2 2 2 3 [9.R21]\nUO +H =UO +H O\n3 2 2 2 [9.R22]\n208 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nor the in which UO is the intermediary:\n2\nUO F +H =UO +2HF\n2 2 2 2 [9.R23]\nUO +H O=UO +H\n2 2 3 2 [9.R24]\nExperimentally, mixing the fluoride with water vapor alone exclusively results in\nUO ; the first filiation is therefore the correct one, since water vapor does not reduce\n3\nUO .\n3\n9.4.2. Labile intermediates\nMost of the time, research into labile intermediates involves the use of very\nsophisticated techniques that require experts in the technique being used. The\nkinetics researcher rarely leads this research on his/her own, but his/her input is\nimportant for the suggestions that can be brought forward with respect to the\npossible presence of some of the compounds. Two main methods are used: chemical\nand physics methods.\n9.4.2.1. Chemical methods\nRadicals or ions react with the suitable reactants in order to follow the\ndisappearance or appearance of one substance resulting from the action of the\nintermediary on the reactant.\n9.4.2.1.1. Paneth’s mirror method\nIn 1930, Paneth’s experiment allowed the existence of free radicals to be\ndemonstrated. A hydrogen flow (see Figure 9.3) drives away the tetramethyl lead\nvapors. The wall of the tube in which the vapors circulate is heated at a specific\npoint, A. The thermal decomposition of the tetramethyl lead results in the formation\nof a lead mirror at point A. If the wall is heated at another point, B, mirror A\ndisappears and a new mirror appears at point B.\nThe process can be explained by the formation of methyl radicals, CH °, coming\n3\nfrom the decomposition of the tetramethyl lead:\nPb(CH )  Pb 4CH [9. R25]\n3 4 3\nWhen radicals are in the presence of lead, tetramethyl lead is renewed.\nReaction Mechanism 209\nThe average lifetime of free radicals can be measured if the gas flow and the\nrequired time to reform mirrors located at increasing distances from the production\nzone are known. This average lifetime value is about 10-2 seconds.\nHydrogen Flow\nB A\nPb(CH °)\n3 4\nFigure 9.3. Paneth’s mirror experiment\nSubstances (M), such as arsenic, sodium, zinc and mercury, are usually used\ninstead of lead. Quantitative measurements are carried out using the dosing of the\ncompound M(R°) .\nn\n9.4.2.1.2. Other examples of chemical methods\nHere we will mention two families for dosing radicals in a liquid medium:\n– The use of iodine or iodhydric acid as radical traps by using fixation or one\niodine atom on one radical:\nR°+ I = RI + I° [9.R26]\n2\nThe disappearance of di-iodine is followed using calorimetry of iodometry. An\nacid–base titration and the following reaction can also be used:\nR°+ IH =RH + I° [9.R27]\n– Colorimetric quantitative analysis by the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH)\nradical. The purple color of this reactant can disappear to become colorless,\nreflecting the formation of the colorless compound.\n210 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n9.4.2.2. Physics methods\nAs reaction intermediates are often present at very low levels or with a very short\nlifetime (or both at the same time), physics-based methods are more suitable for\ntheir analysis, especially methods focused on the use of spectroscopy and resonance.\nAmong the most frequently used methods are:\n– absorption or emission spectroscopy;\n– electronic paramagnetic resonance; and\n– Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of an adsorbed phase.\nWith heterogeneous reactions leading to the formation of a solid, the reaction\nintermediates, including adsorbed gases, are temporary defects. This knowledge was\ngained by the use of physics-based methods: electric conductivity, Hall effect,\nspectroscopies, etc.\nAs already mentioned, the use of different techniques to the full extent of their\ncapacities requires experts who are often associated with studies of kinetics.\n9.5. Back to the modes and laws of kinetics\nThe main kinetic modes provide comparatively complex reaction rate laws, the\nresults of which depend on the type of mode chosen. The experimental comparison\nof these laws is one of the aspects of mechanism validation.\n9.5.1. Modes with a single rate-determining step\nSuch modes are obtained by writing the pseudo-steady state and that each step,\nexcept the rate-determining step, are at equilibrium.\nSuch a mode provides a rate law that is the product of one kinetic term and the\ndistance from the equilibrium conditions, with the kinetic term being the reaction\nrate when the reaction is far from the equilibrium.\nBy applying the law of mass action for all the non-rate-determining steps, the\nreaction rate far from the equilibrium is such that it often admits an order with\nrespect to some reactants and/or products. In this case, concentrations of the\ndifferent reagents and products are separate variables apart from each other and from\ntemperature. Only “catalytic” sequences such as adsorption disturb these properties.\nReaction Mechanism 211\n9.5.2. Modes with multiple rate-determining steps\nWith these modes, two (or more) steps are rate-determining, with others having\ninfinite rate coefficients and so are always at equilibrium. The mode is either in a\npseudo-steady state or not.\nIt is known that for some reactions, the reaction rates of such pseudo-steady state\nmodes are given by the overall rate law (the law of the slowness) for a reaction. This\nlaw says that the reverse rate of the reaction is the sum of the reverse of the rates of\nthe determining step modes.\nThis law of the slowness step is only valid if the reaction mechanism follows\nsome conditions:\n– the rate-determining steps belong to a linear sequence not involved in a loop;\n– every rate-determining step has the same multiplying coefficient.\nThe law of the slowness involves the “sum” function, so the result may contain\nnumerous sums, meaning that concentrations are not separated from each other and\nthe temperature.\n9.5.3. Pseudo-steady state modes\nThe form of the expression of the rate of such modes can be complex\nnevertheless a category of modes is like those described above and obeys the law of\nthe slownesses (usable under the same conditions) the sum corresponding then\nincluding all the determining modes made possible by the mechanism.\nHaving the same form as the previous (see section 9.5.2), the expression of rates\nwill have the same characteristics.\nThere is therefore some correlation between the form of rate law and acceptable\nmodes, hence the importance of what we call the test experiments.\n9.5.4. Link between the form of the rate equation and the presence of some\nelementary steps\nThe presence of the concentration of a species in a certain form indicates a\nstrong probability of certain types of elementary reactions:\n– the square root of a concentration most likely involves the symmetric\ndissociation of the corresponding compound;\n212 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n– the influence of a product concentration implies that one of the products is the\nreactant of one of the elementary steps. This reaction is therefore either the rate-\ndetermining step or is occurring before the rate-determining step;\n– the presence of a homographic term of a partial pressure indicates a step in\nwhich the adsorbed molecule is the reactant of one of the elementary steps.\n9.6. Experimental tests\nHaving identified the reaction mechanism and stoichiometric coefficients, the\nexperimental values (measured rate, measured fractional extent) can be used to\ndetermine the kinetic values, including the fractional extent and the rate (or\nreactivity). To do this, it is crucial for a reaction to undergo the pseudo-steady state\ntest. Indeed, it is only when this test has been satisfied that the reaction will be\ndefined by the reaction rate only, whatever the component or measurement\nanalyzed. If this test is not satisfied, we will have to remember that each\nmeasurement is defined by its own fractional extent or a combination of several\nfractional extents. In the search for a kinetic mode, several methods are used. These\nwill now be reviewed.\n9.6.1. Experimental methods\nThese methods use techniques involved in following the extent of a reaction\nunder specific conditions or with data analyzed differently.\n9.6.1.1. Ostwald’s isolation method\nIn a closed system, this method aims to “isolate” the variations in the quantity of\none of the reactants. The reaction is occurring in a mix, where each reactant except\none is present in great excess. Hence, the amount (and concentrations, eventually)\nand influence of all the reactants in excess are considered constant during the\nmeasurement. The amount of the isolated reactant will be the only thing changing as\na function of the fractional extent.\nProducts formed are also among the reactants to be taken into account.\nA variation of this method consists of carrying out the reaction without the\nisolation of a component, i.e. using a large amount for each component so that all\nthe amounts remain constant during the whole reaction. In this case, the reaction\noccurs within an extremely small fractional extent.\nReaction Mechanism 213\n9.6.1.2. The switch method\nThe switch method consists of a sudden change in the value of one of the\nintensive quantities (temperature, concentration of one of the reactants, or partial gas\npressure) during the reaction. Its effect is evaluated on an integral or derived curve\n(fractional extent against time, rate against time or rate against fractional extent).\nFigure 9.4 shows an example of a switch in temperature on an integrate curve (a)\nand the derivate curve (b). At the switch point, D, the spatial function has a given\nvalue, E . The volumic rate (rate per unit of volume – or surface rate) on the left of\nD\npoint D are defined by the physico-chemical conditions (temperature T,\nconcentration C) preceding the switch. The one on the right side of point D is\ncalculated considering the physico-chemical conditions (temperature T’ and\nconcentration C) after the switch point.\nFigure 9.4. a) Integral; and b) derived forms of a temperature switch\n9.6.1.3. Separated variables\nWith the aim of modeling a reaction, it is interesting to know which separate\nvariables define the reaction rate. These include the concentration and partial\npressure as well as the fractional extent of every separate variable included in the\nexpression of a reaction’s rate. If the rate can be written as a product of several\nfunctions, each of them being one of the variables, the reaction’s rate would be\nwritten as:\nr  f(A 1 ,...,A i ,T,)g 1 (A 1 )....g i (A i ).h(T).m() [9.2]\n214 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe method applies the theorem of separated variables, which is defined as: if\ntwo curves representing function y with variable x obtained for two values of\nparameter a are subtracted from each other by an orthogonal affinity of axis Ox,\norientation Oy and ratio k; in the expression of the function, variable x is separated.\nHence, if k is independent from x, we can write:\ny f(a ,x)\n1  1 k\n[9.3]\ny f(a ,x)\n2 2\nthereby:\ny f(a,x)g(a).h(x)\n[9.4]\nand vice versa.\nSuppose that we want know whether the temperature variable is a separated\nvariable. Two experimental curves of rate versus fractional extent must be plotted\nfor the same pressure and two separate temperatures (see Figure 9.5).\nFigure 9.5. Experimental curves at two separate temperatures\nReaction Mechanism 215\nFrom the first curve at pressure P and temperature T , four points of fractional\n1\nextents A, B, C and D (distant enough from each other) and four rate values must be\nchosen. Using the same points of fractional extent on the second curve for a pressure\nP and temperature T , four other points A', B', C' and D', and four new rates values\n2\nare obtained.\nOn a set of rate/temperature axes the rate for each point A, B, C and D as well as\nA', B', C' and D' for each temperature, T and T is plotted(see Figure 9.6).\n1 2\nFigure 9.6. Determination of the separation of variable T\nIf the temperature is a variable separated from P and , the series of points A\nand A', B and B', C and C', and D and D' belong to four curves – iso-concentrations\nwith an iso-extent – in the axis system v(T) that can be deduced from each other by\nthe orthogonal affinity of temperatures axis and the rate axis orientation. This means\nthat there is the following relation between distances:\nHA H'A' HA H'A' HA H'A'\n   [9.5]\nHB H'B' HC H'C' HD H'D'\nand the rate can be written:\nv(T,P,α)=h(P,α).g(T) [9.6]\n216 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n9.6.2. The pseudo-steady state mode test\nTo prove the pseudo-steady state mode, two methods are used to determine the\nreaction rate and the measured rate. The first method is simultaneously compared to\nthe one measured by calorimetry.\nIf the ratio of both rate measurements is the same at any time, the system is\npseudo-steady state. To visualize it (see Figure 9.7), the ratio of two measurements\nis calculated at a given time and one of the two curves is re-calculated using the\nother one and the ratio value. If both curves obtained merge as a function of time,\nthe system is pseudo-stationary.\nFigure 9.7. Comparison of two physics measurements related to the reaction\n9.6.3. Research into the uniqueness of the space function mechanism or E test\nThis test is carried out after the pseudo-steady state test, since it is only valid if\nthe former is satisfied.\nThe E test aims to determine whether the rate measured is written as a product\nof a function of only physico-chemical variables (temperature, concentrations,\npartial pressure, etc.) by a function of the morphological characteristics of a medium\n(surface-to-volume ratio, area of interfaces, volumes of the phases, etc.).\nReaction Mechanism 217\nIn homogenous kinetics the method is used to prove that there is only one way,\nwithout parallel ways, for the reaction to happen. This is no longer true if a reaction\noccurs simultaneously within and on the walls of the reactor.\nWith heterogeneous kinetics, a positive result means the mode has one or several\nrate-determining steps with the same space function. If the result is negative, it\nmeans the reaction does not occur within one rate-determining step.\nThis test is performed using constant concentrations in either an open or closed\nsystem using a concentrated medium and undergoing temperature switches.\nFigure 9.8. Principle of the E test\nThe first experiment is carried out (see Figure 9.8) at temperature T and at a\ngiven time t , the temperature is changed to T’ with all other variables being kept\n1\nconstant. The same experiment is then repeated, but the temperature change is\ncarried out at a different time, t . If the test is satisfied, we must have:\n2\nrt\n1\n\n\n(T,P,...)E(t\n1\n)\n\n(T,P,...)\n[9.7]\nr't  (T',P,...)E(t ) (T',P,...)\n1 1\nrt\n2\n\n\n(T,P,...)E(t\n2\n)\n\n(T,P,...)\n[9.8]\nr't  (T',P,...)E(t ) (T',P,...)\n2 2\nHence the quotient of the rate on the left- and right-hand side of the switch point\nmust not depend on time. To verify the test, we need to carry out several switches at\n218 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\ndifferent times and plot the quotient of the right- over left-hand side rates as a\nfunction of time, obtaining a horizontal line.\n9.7. Looking for the type of rate law\nThe type of rate law as a function of the different variables (concentrations,\ntemperature and fractional extent) can be quite diverse. For this reason, some\nadditional experiments will provide extra information about the form of law\ninvolved. These additional experiments are carried out according to specific\nmethodologies.\n9.7.1. Research into the influence of concentrations\nThe law of rates as a function of concentrations is the basic element of\nmechanism verification. For many years, researchers have worked on the integrated\ncurves of fractional extent as a function of time. Indeed, the experiment generally\ngives these data directly. We must notice, however, that modeling leads to relations\nderived from the rate as a function of concentrations and that the integration of such\nan expression is often difficult or even impossible. With the rise of the digital era, it\nis now easy to obtain both derived and integrated experimental curves. The first\nexperimental curves are then compared to the modeling results.\n9.7.1.1. Qualitative research\nThe first piece information that needs to be obtained on the function of a reactant\nis whether its concentration affects the rate of reaction. This qualitative information\ncan be simply obtained using a concentration switch.\nIn a gaseous medium, the switch is achieved by replacing a portion of the inert\ngas with high concentration of the gas being studied.\nIn solution, the addition of the reactant being studied must be done while\nkeeping the concentrations of all the other reactants at the same level. There are two\npossible ways to do this:\n– using the isolation method, starting with a low concentration of the reactant\nbeing studied and adding a small amount of pure reactant or concentrate in solution;\nor\n– adding a solution identical to the one obtained at the switch point, except for\nthe concentration of the reactant being studied. The additions will be done at the\nsame temperature.\nReaction Mechanism 219\nIn any case, the influence of a reactant – if its concentration has an influence –\ninduces a sudden change in the reaction rate.\n9.7.1.2. Quantitative research\nTo carry out quantitative research, the isothermal rate curves must be plotted for\nseparate values of the concentration being studied. The isolation method must be\nused so the other reactant concentrations are kept constant during the reaction.\n9.7.1.2.1. Is the reactant concentration a separate variable?\nUsing the previous curves, the method from section 9.6.1.3 is used if the\nconcentration is a separate variable in the expression of the rate. Using the result, a\nmechanism model is obtained, and so is the rate–concentration relationship. If the\nconcentration is not a separate variable, the model must take that into account, and\nthe law given by the model has to be compared with the rate–concentration curves\nobtained for different fractional extents.\nIf the concentration is a separate variable, the order of the reaction must be\ndetermined for one of the reactants. This is achieved using van ’t Hoff’s differential\nmethod.\n9.7.1.2.2. Determination of the reaction rate order\nIf the reaction has an order for reactant A, the rate can be written:\ni\nv  kA β i\ni [9.9]\nwhere k is the pseudo-coefficient of the rate and includes all the other concentrations\nand temperatures.\nThis equation can be tested using decimal, entire or quotient values, or by using\nthe logarithm scale:\nlnv  lnk β lnA \ni i [9.10]\nBy plotting the logarithm of the rate as a function of the logarithm of the\nconcentration, a straight line of a gradient representing the partial order of the\nreaction is obtained (see Figure 9.9).\n220 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nln v\nln [A]\ni\nFigure 9.9. Determining of the order of a reaction by the differential method\nConsidering the variations caused by the logarithm scale, it is important to\ndouble-check the order determined by plotting the rate against the concentration at\nthe power of the order determined. This should result in a straight line.\n9.7.2. Research into the influence of temperature\nResearch into the influence of temperature involves:\n– determining a quantitative expression using one or several “temperature\ncoefficients”, allowing us to obtain the reaction rate for a different temperature to\nthose used during the experiments; and\n– confirming the model hypothesis.\n9.7.2.1. Research into the temperature coefficient\nThe temperature coefficient only exists if the temperature is a separate variable,\nwhich must be verified using the method detailed in section 9.6.1.3. If this is the\ncase, the Arrhenius coordinates must be used by plotting the logarithm of the rate\nagainst the reverse of the temperature (see Figure 9.10). These curves often result in\na straight line of gradient m. The temperature coefficient is the measure  defined\nfrom the following expression of the volumic (or surface) rate:\nΞ\nv  Aexp [9.11]\nRT\nwhere A is called the pre-exponential factor. Here, we can write:\nΞ  -Rm [9.12]\nReaction Mechanism 221\nwhere  has the same units as the activation energy (joule.mole-1), but it is too\nearly to merge both as the activation energy is only defined for the elementary steps.\nIf the temperature is not a separate variable, a possible temperature coefficient is\nof little interest to us as it has many chances to be a function of all the rate variables:\nconcentrations, time, etc.\nln v\n1/T\nFigure 9.10. Use of the Arrhenius coordinates to determine the\ntemperature coefficient of a reaction\n9.7.2.2. Model and influence of temperature\nWhen a model hypothesis is available, various modes of the expression of the\nrates–concentrations can be deduced. These expressions usually involve rate\ncoefficients from elementary steps and, eventually, equilibrium constants. At this\nstage, Arrhenius’ law can be applied to the rate coefficients, with an activation\nenergy for each. For the equilibrium constants, van ’t Hoff’s law, which involves\nreaction enthalpy, can be applied and written as:\nΔH0\nK =K0exp- [9.13]\nRT\nIt is only after introducing these substitutions that the rate law according to the\ntemperature can be obtained. Arrhenius’ law can thus be checked to see whether the\ntheory is correct. If this is the case, a physics-based definition can be given to the\ntemperature coefficient as a function of the activation energies and enthalpy of the\nelementary steps.\nIf the temperature coefficient has several values according to the temperature, we\nwill determine whether the changes in the Arrhenius curve correlate with a change\nof mode, especially a change in the rate-limiting steps with temperature.\n\nChapter 10\nTheory of the Activated Complex\nin the Gas Phase\nThis chapter presents modeling of the elementary steps in the gas phase. Its aim\nis to determine the reactivity of an elementary reaction step, the expression of the\nrate coefficient and its variation with temperature.\n10.1. The notion of molecular energy: energy of a group of atoms\nAn elementary reaction is in effect only the result of the re-distribution of\nenergies within a group of atoms, which explains the importance of the molecular\nenergy approach.\nTo determine the “reaction pathway”, we must determine the energy of a system\nmade up of a certain number of atoms, of which the molecule is a specific case. It is\nnot our intention to present quantic modeling, which leads to the calculation of\nenergies, but to summarize the results that will be used later.\n10.1.1. Energy of a group of two atoms\nThe theoretical studies of molecular bonds of molecules made of only two atoms\ncan be classified in two categories according to the complexity of the atoms\ninvolved:\n224 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n– the theoretical studies are mostly carried on the hydrogenoid ion,\nH+\n, for which\n2\nit is possible to follow rigorous calculations;\n– semi-empirical studies that, taking into account the result obtained in the prior\nstudy, can be generalized to other molecules without permitting a complete\ncalculation. This is the result presented here.\nE\n(II)\nX+Y r\n0\nD\ne (I)\nh\n–D 0\nr 2\n0\nFigure 10.1. Energy of a set of two atoms\nBased on the Heitler–London model, when two hydrogen atoms located slightly\naway from each other (origin of energies) move closer, there are two possibilities:\n– If the two atoms have electrons spinning in opposite directions, they attract\neach other to form a chemical bond and the energy changes depending on the\ndistance r separating them following curve I of Figure 10.1. Thus the energy can be\nwritten:\nQ\nE  [10.1]\nI\n1\nIn this equation, Q,  and  are integrals defined for the distance r and issued\nfrom the Schrödinger equation. Q is called Coulomb’s integral and  is the\nexchange integral. The value  varies only a little and is often considered to be zero.\n– If the atoms getting closer have parallel electron spins, this results in a\nrepulsive energy following curve II on Figure 10.1, which is defined by the\nfollowing relationship:\nQ\nE  [10.2]\nII\n1\nCurve I can be plotted experimentally using spectroscopic observations for any\nbi-atomic molecule. This cannot be done for curve II.\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 225\nEquations [10.1] and [10.2] do not show the inter-atom distance r and therefore\ndo not allow calculation of the energy for two atoms according to distance. This led\nMorse and Sato to propose simpler functions including r to represent curves I and II.\nMorse’s law represents curve I and is written as:\nE D1exp2a(rr )2expa(rr ) [10.3]\nI 0 0\nIn this equation, D is the difference between the origin of energies and the\nminimum value of the curve. D is the residual energy, which is the vibration energy\ne\nat absolute zero: h /2, r is the inter-atom distance for the minimum energy, which\n0 0\nis the equilibrium distance of the molecule. Constant a depends on the light speed c;\nmolecule reduced mass  ( is related to the atomic masses by the equations in\n[10.5]); Plank’s constant h; and value x as defined by [10.5].

Energy of an even number of atoms\nWe now consider a molecule with four atoms represented in Figure 10.2 (the\natoms are not necessarily co-planarians).\nLet us assume that the values of Coulomb’s integrals (determined by the\nprevious method) A , A , B , B , C and C and the exchange integrals  ,  ,  ,  ,\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n226 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n and  of all bi-atomic couples XZ, XW, YZ, YW, XY and WZ as a function of the\n1 2\ndifferent inter-atomic distances r , r , r , r , r and r are known.

Energy of an odd number of atoms\nConsider a system with three atoms, as represented in Figure 10.3.

Interactions between three atoms\n10.2. Bimolecular reactions in the gas phase\nEarly on, researchers thought that the reaction between two substances required a\nmeeting between the molecules of these two reactants. Early theories attempting to\nexplain the reaction rate naturally relied on encounters between molecules. Collision\ntheory does so by treating the molecules as rigid spheres and, in addition to the\nclash, imposing a minimum energy required for the molecules to meet. Thus\nTrautz’s calculations in Germany and Mac Lewis’ calculations in the United States,\nin 1917, independently accounted for both the influence of temperature by\nArrhenius’ law and the proportionality of reaction rate to the concentration of both\nreactants (second-order reaction). Alas, calculations based on the classical\nmechanics of the collision of rigid spheres led to values for reaction rates that were\ngenerally much too high compared with experimental measurements. The difference\nof a ratio of up to several orders of magnitude was bigger, since the molecules\ninvolved were more complex. In this chapter and Chapter 11 we chose to present the\ntheory of activated complex obtained from Eyring and Polanyi’s seminal works in\nthe 1940s.\n228 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n10.2.1. Postulate of the activated molecular collision\nModern theories, if they retain the notion of an encounter between molecules,\nhave profoundly changed the nature of the meeting. We now call collision between\ntwo molecules, A and B, the establishment of energy interaction between these\nmolecules over time. This interaction can have multiple consequences and thus lead\nto various phenomena, such as the deviation of molecules from their initial\ntrajectories, the transfer of energy from one molecule to another, breaking a bond in\na molecule, the melting of the two molecules into one, etc.\nConsider an immobile molecule B surrounded by a gas of molecules A with a\nrelative flow J. The efficient section Q of B for one of the previous phenomena is\ni\ndJ. This is the number of encounter molecules A per unit of time and of area with a\nunit flux J and undergoes the shock with the concerned phenomena. We can see that\nQ (the efficient section) has area units. In the given conditions, the value of the\ni\nefficient section evidently depends on the phenomenon concerned.\nWe will admit the following postulation as the basis of the modeling of\nelementary reactions.\nPOSTULATION 10.1.– An elementary reaction between two molecules, A and B,\nrequires a collision, in the sense given above to this term, between a molecule of A\nand a molecule of B. The collision must occur in the geometrical conditions (relative\nposition between the two molecules) and at a given energy level. Under the effect of\nthe collision, there is a redistribution of energies within the molecules that leads to\nthe final products of the reaction.\nThe modeling of a reaction then appears like the evolution of a system made of\nnuclei and electrons of mass m over time. This evolution will be entirely defined by\nj\nthe wave function , which is the solution of the corresponding Schrödinger’s\nequation, in which E is the potential energy of the system and is written as:\np\nh2  1  2Φ  2Φ  2Φ h Φ\n       E Φ  \n8π2 j   m j   x2 y2 z2    p 2πi t\nAlas, there is no method allowing the calculation of the wave function during a\nmolecular collision, although we use approximate methods, of which the most\nadvanced is the Eyring’s activated complex theory.\nWithin the scope of this theory, we will look at the case of a reaction between an\natom X and a bi-atomic molecule YZ of the following type:\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 229\nX + YZ→XY + Z [10.R1]\nFor this, we will write that the system evolves in a way that constantly minimizes\nits potential energy.\n10.2.2. Potential energy surface\nHere again, we consider a system with three atoms and will calculate its potential\nenergy for different configurations. These configurations could be of any form, but\nin our case it will be enough to look at the case where the three atoms are aligned\n(we show that it corresponds to the case of minimal energies, see Figure 10.4). The\nconfiguration is therefore characterized by the inter-atomic distances r between\n1\natoms X and Y, and r between atoms Y and Z.\n2\nr r\n1 2\nX Z\nY\nFigure 10.4. System with three atoms in a line\nBy plotting the potential energy on the z-axis and the two inter-atomic distances\non the x and y-axes, we obtain the potential-energy surfaces, which are represented\nin Figure 10.5.\nFigure 10.5. Potential energy surface in a system including three atoms in alignment\n230 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFigure 10.6. Potential energy diagram of a system with three atoms in alignment\nAs shown in Figure 10.6, we can plot the equienergy curves seen on these\nsurfaces and transpose them onto a 2D plot and thereby establish the potential\nenergy curves in the system of axis r – r . We obtain the potential-energy diagram\n1 2\nof the system considered. The origin of energies is often taken for the X atom\nlocated at an infinite distance from the bi-atomic YZ molecule, which requires some\nchanges to London’s equation.\nWith an infinite r value, the XY molecule and the Z atom are again infinitely\n2\ndistant from each other. With an infinite r value, however, we find the Morse’s\n1\ncurve of the YZ molecule.\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 231\nThe same type of diagram can be produced whatever the number of atoms\ninvolved. However, the representation will not be easy because of the complexity.\nWe often plot the diagram for configurations leading to minimal energies (three\natoms aligned and four co-planar atoms).\n10.2.3. Reaction pathways and the equivalent “mass point”\nWe have shown that we can change the axes of the potential energy curves in\nFigure 10.6 so that we have a system of axes Oxy, not necessarily orthogonal, is the\nevolution of energy for a set of three atoms moving along the valley, which have\nkinetic energy in the form:\n 2 2\n1 dx dy\nE c       [10.13]\n2 dt   dt  \n \nSo in this representation the three-atom system is energetically equivalent to a\n“mass point” of mass , sliding without friction along the valley. The kinetic energy\nof this particle is given by equation [10.13] and its potential energy is given by the\nz-axis in the new potential-energy diagram. We show that the new system of axis\n(E\np\n, r\n1\n, r\n2\n/c*, see Figure 10.7a) is such that:\n1/2\n m m \nsin X Z  [10.14]\n\nm\nX\nm\nY\nm\nY\nm\nZ\n\n\nm m m \nX Y Z\n [10.15]\nm m m \nX Y Z\nm m m \nX Y Z\nc* [10.16]\nm m m \nZ X Y\nyE E\np\n232 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFigure 10.7. Three-atom system: a) definition of skewed coordinates;\nand b) definition of a reaction pathway\nThe new diagram therefore has the shape shown in Figure 10.7b. The pathway\non which the mass point is climbing is the reaction path. We notice that the point\nstarts from the initially low position and climbs along the valley. If it has enough\ninitial kinetic energy, it will be able to overcome the pass separating the two valleys\nand go back down to the final state.\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 233\nFigure 10.8. Classic activation energy and pathway energy curves\nWe usually represent this energetic climb on a two-axis plot (see Figure 10.8)\nwith the potential-energy on the y-axis and the position of the mass point on the\nreaction pathway on the x-axis. This course shows that the point must overcome an\nenergetic barrier with the height,\nE\n, called the classic activation energy at absolute\n0\nzero. The group of atoms in the associated configuration at the top of the pass is\ncalled the activated complex.\n10.2.4. Absolute expression of the reaction rate\nWe will now calculate the number of “mass points” that cross the pass per time\nunit in order to express the reaction rate.\nIt is presumed that the activated complex is located within a box of arbitrary\nwidth which is located at the top of the barrier. The net reaction rate is defined by\nthe average speed at which the activated complex surmounts the barrier. The\nprobability p(v) for our mass point to have a speed between v and v + dv along a\ndegree of freedom, with k being the Boltzman’s constant, is:\nB\n μv2\np(v)  Const .exp  dv [10.17]\n \nk T\n B \n234 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe average mass point speed of the activated complex at the top of the barrier,\nin the sense of crossing, is:\n\n μv2\n exp  vdv\n \n0 k T\n B \nv  [10.18]\n\n μv2\n exp  dv\n \n k T\n B \nThe integration limits of the denominator are between –∞ and +∞ because the\nmass point can move in both directions, but only one direction is efficient so the\nnumerator integration limits are between 0 and +∞.

It is conceivable that some of them may fall back on the same side, hence\nthe introduction of a transmission coefficient,. It is also conceivable that the value\nof  may depend on the shape of the summit, in particular the reaction path (Figure\n10.8). In the absence of a more accurate initial value, the approximation of  = 1/2\nmay be selected for an almost symmetrical barrier. It appears that this value can be\nmuch lower for reactions involving the exchange of electrons.\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 235\nMoreover, the reaction rate is assumed to be of second order. If k is the rate\ncoefficient, the rate can be defined as:\nv  kXYZ [10.22]\nBy joining expressions [10.21] and [10.22], we have:\n \nXYZ k T\nkXYZ  α B [10.23]\nδ 2πμ\nAt equilibrium between the activated complex and the initial state, we have an\nequivalence relationship:\nXYZ\nk X YZ α   eq k B T [10.24]\nequ eq eq δ 2πμ\nYet at equilibrium, we can apply the law of mass action [A2.53] (see Appendix\n2) by introducing the partition function of our mass point for both the initial state\nand activated complex Z*:\n[X é êë X ] YZ [Y ¹ Z ù úû e ] q = Z Z* Z exp æ ç ç ççè - R E T 0 ¹ö ø ÷ ÷ ÷ ÷ [10.25]\neq eq XY Z\nFor our point at the top of the barrier, the degree of freedom of translation\ncrossing the pass plays a specific role. Therefore by taking into account [A2.34] (see\nAppendix 2), the partition function of the activated complex can be written as:\n2πμ k T\nZ*  Z B δ [10.26]\nh\nOtherwise we accept the assumption that the rate coefficient at equilibrium is the\nsame as when it is far from equilibrium or:\n[10.27]\nBy combining [10.23], [10.24], [10.25] and [10.26], the rate coefficient becomes:\nαk T Z  E \nk  B exp  0  [10.28]\n \nh Z Z RT\nX YZ  \n236 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe term k\nB\nT/h is a frequency with a value of 2.1010 T.\nWe thereby obtain the rate coefficient of the reaction rate of a bimolecular\nreaction of second order.\nNOTE 10.1.– Although never written, the result of equation [10.28] is identical to\nthe one that would have been obtained by writing the equilibrium between activated\ncomplex and reactants and deducting the activated complex concentration from the\nmass action law [10.21]. Numerous authors calculate the reaction rate in this way.\nNote that the rigorous calculation that we did does not involve any equilibrium, as\ntheoretical considerations show that this cannot exist. The method involving the\nequilibrium between reactants in an activated complex is actually a mnemonic\ndevice to achieve the same result.\n10.2.5. Partition functions of the activated complex\nTo calculate the partition functions, we abandon our mass point and go back to\nmolecules and atoms. The use of the equation [10.25] is required to calculate the\npartition functions of both the reactants and the activated complex. If the reactant\npartition functions can be calculated without problem using their characteristics (see\nAppendix 2), we must spend time calculating the partition function of the activated\ncomplex.\nThe partition functions of the activated complex are calculated using partition\nfunctions related to each degree of freedom and applying equation [A2.27] (see\nAppendix 2) for the characteristics of the activated complex.\n10.2.5.1. Translation function of partition\nWith the activated complex, the bond dimensions are given by the coordinates of\nthe pass of the potential energy diagram. This complex has three degrees of freedom\nof translation and the term corresponding to volume V is:\n3/2\n2π(m  m  m )k T\nZ t   X Y Z B  V [10.29]\n h \n10.2.5.2. Rotation function of partition\nIn our particular case, the activated complex is linear and therefore has two\ndegrees of freedom of rotation, and the rotation contribution is:\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 237\n8π2Ik T\nZ  B [10.30]\nr h2\nThe momentum of inertia is calculated from the masses and already known\ndimensions.\n10.2.5.3. Vibration function of partition\nThe activated complex molecule theoretically has 9 – 3 – 2 = 4 degrees of\nfreedom of vibration. In fact, the molecule cannot vibrate in the same direction as\nthe Y-Z bond, which is breaking down, and only has three degrees of freedom of\nvibration. The contribution of vibration will be:\n1\n  hν \nZ   1exp i  [10.31]\n i1 to 3     k B T    \n\nThe calculation of this term requires the vibration frequency  of the activated\ni\ncomplex. The mechanics of small movements allows us to calculate the vibration\nfrequency from the potential energy diagram (see Appendix 3). Plotting the diagram\nof the potential energies will allow us to calculate all the characteristics of the\nactivated complex. The activation energy value can also be read directly from the\nplot.\n10.2.6. Evaluation of the pre-exponential factor\nNow consider a reaction between polyatomic molecules. As a first\napproximation, we can consider the partition functions of each type of energy as\nconsisting of terms for a degree of freedom equal to z, z and z depending on\nt r v,\nwhether it is a translation, rotation or vibration. The partition function of a molecule\nper unit of volume will be:\nt r v\nZ z z z [10.32]\nt r v\nwhere t, r, v are the numbers of the degree of translation, rotation and vibration,\nrespectively.\nThus, in the case of the previous example of an atom X with its diatomic\nmolecule YZ, we would have:\n238 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nZ z 3 ,Z z 3 z 2 z and Z z 3 z 2 z 3 [10.33]\nX t YZ t r v t r v\nAccording to [10.28], the pre-exponential factor of the rate coefficient is:\nk T Z¹ k T z2\nk =α B = B r [10.34]\n0 h Z Z 2h z3\nX YZ t\nNow consider the example of a reaction between molecule A containing a\nnumber of atoms and molecule B containing b number of atoms. The activated\ncomplex will have a + b atoms.\nMolecule A will have three degrees of both translation and rotation, and 9a – 6\ndegrees of vibration.\nMolecule B will have three degrees of both translation and rotation, and 9b – 6\ndegrees of vibration.\nThe activated complex, which has one degree of freedom less than the normal\nmolecule with the same dimensions, will have three degrees of both translation and\nrotation and 9(a + b) – 6 – 1 degrees of vibration.\nThe pre-exponential factor will therefore be:\nk T Z¹ k T z5\nk =α B = B v [10.35]\n0 h Z Z 2h z3z3\nX YZ t r\nWe can go further by using terms of the partition functions with the order of\nmagnitudes listed in Table A2.2 (see Appendix 2). Using equations [10.34] and\n[10.35] leads to the following:\n– for a reaction of one atom with a bi-atomic molecule:\nk T z2\nk  B r 3.1010T to 3.108T [10.36]\n0 2h z3\nt\n– for a reaction between molecules A and B:\nk T\nz5\nk  B v 3.1020T to 3.1023T [10.37]\n0 2h z3z3\nt r\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 239\nThese equations allow us to reach orders of magnitudes for the pre-exponential\nfactors that are compatible with experimental values.\n10.2.7. Activation energies\n10.2.7.1. Classic activation energy and point zero\nThe classic activation energy\nE\nat absolute zero temperature (0 K), which is\n0\nprovided from the potential energy diagram, does not take into account the residual\nenergy of vibration at this temperature and is defined for each vibration of frequency\nby: h/2\ni.\nFigure 10.9 uses Figure 10.8 and adds the residual energies of the reactants and\nthe activated complex. The true activation energy\nE\nat 0 K can easily be calculated\n0\nwith the following relationship:\nhν hν\nE  Δ(U)  i   r [10.38]\n0 0\n2 2\nFigure 10.9. Difference between classic activation energy and\nthe free energy of a true activation\nIn this equation, the first sum is expanded to all frequencies of vibration of the\nactivated complex and the second sum to all frequencies of vibration of all reactants.\n10.2.7.2. Thermodynamic formulation of the reaction rate\nUsing equation [10.28], we can express the rate constant by adding the\nequilibrium constant,\nK\n:\nc\n240 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nαk T\nk= B K¹ [10.39]\nh c\nThe\nconstantK\nissued from the partition function would be the constant of an\nc\n“equilibrium” between the activated complex and reactants.

Activation energy of the elementary step\nBy using the natural logarithm of the reaction rate coefficient definition [10.42],\nwe have:\nαk\nΔ(S¹) Δ(U¹)\nlnk=ln B +lnT+ 0 - 0 [10.47]\nh R RT\nFrom derivation of the temperature, we obtain:\ndlnk 1\nΔ(U¹)\n= + 0 [10.48]\ndT T RT2\nThis derivation defines the “experimental” activation energy E of the\na\nelementary step, therefore:\n \ndlnk 1 ΔU E\n  0  a [10.49]\ndT T RT2 RT2\nfrom which the activation energy of the elementary step is defined:\nE =RT+Δ(H¹)-PΔ(V¹) [10.50]\na 0 0\nIn the case of perfect gases, the activation energy is:\nE =RT é 1-(ån¹)ù+Δ(H¹) [10.51]\na êë i úû 0\n242 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIn the case of reaction [10.R1], where\nn\n1, the activation energy\ni\nbecomes:\n \nE  Δ H  2RT\na 0 [10.52]\nAll these expressions eventually provide a definition of the activation energy of\nthe elementary step that varies slightly with temperature. These variations are nearly\nimpossible to detect experimentally, since the range of variations for one reaction is\nusually quite narrow in order to keep reaction rates measurable.\n10.2.8. Units and other forms of the reaction rate coefficient\n10.2.8.1. Other expressions of the reaction rate coefficient\nThe examination of equation [10.22] shows that the units of the reaction rate\ncoefficient k are m3.mol-1.s-1.\nIf we take into account equation [10.39], the reaction rate coefficient can also be\nwritten as:\nk= αk B T K¹(PV) åni ¹ = αk B T K¹(RT) (åni ¹) [10.53]\nh p h p\nIn the case of reaction [10.R1], this equation becomes:\nαk T K¹\nk= B p [10.54]\nh RT\n10.2.8.2. Other forms of the reaction rate coefficient\nUsing equation [10.22], we have defined the reaction rate coefficient of the\nvolumic rate of a bimolecular reaction, such as reaction [10.R1], as a function of\nconcentration. In some cases with gases, we prefer to define the reaction rate using\nthe partial pressure instead of the concentration, which is described by a new\nreaction rate coefficient, k in:\np,\nP P\nv=k X YZ [10.55]\np P2\n0\nwhere P represents the reference pressure. If we choose a reference pressure of one\n0\natmosphere, the reaction rate becomes:\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 243\nv=k P P [10.56]\np X YZ\nIf the pressure units are in atmospheres, the reaction rate coefficient is therefore\nexpressed in mol.s-1.m-3.atm.-2.\nThe new reaction rate coefficient can be linked to the one defined by\nconcentration by writing:\nk =k(RT)2 [10.57]\np\nA new apparent activation energy E' corresponds to a new reaction rate\na\ncoefficient, such as:\ndlnk E'\np = a [10.58]\ndT RT2\nor by using equations [10.48] and [10.58]:\nE' =E +2RT [10.59]\na a\n10.3. Monomolecular reactions in the gas phase\nBy definition, a monomolecular reaction must involve only one molecule, like\nfor example decomposition and isomerization reactions. Such a reaction will\ntherefore be written:\nABC [10.R2]\nWe accept that the reaction does not occur at an infinite rate (i.e. the\ndecomposition is not spontaneous for the group of molecules), but that it would be\nbetter if at each instant only one fraction of the molecule was ready to break down.\nThus we derive the idea that only one fraction of molecule A acquires enough energy\nto spontaneously trigger bond breakage. Moreover, with a reaction that is\ntemperature-activated (without any radiation intervention), it is known that only a\nbimolecular collision permits the energy transfer from one molecule to the other,\nand thereby can result in some molecules having higher energies than others. How is\nit therefore possible to explain that a bimolecular collision can lead to a first order\nreaction rate with respect to the reactant? The response is defined by the first\ncondition, that modeling will have to obey the knowledge that normally, as we have\nseen before, the bimolecular collision results in a second order reaction rate.\n244 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe second challenge for modeling is to report experimental results\nincorporating the reaction order for a high enough pressure and the knowledge that\nat lower pressure the reaction is second order in relation to the reactants.\nLindemann proposed the following model, which takes into account these two\nrequirements. Lindemann concedes that a monomolecular reaction is not\nelementary, but the result of a mechanism including three steps:\n– a first activation step in which the collision between two A molecules allows\none of them (the activated molecule labeled A*) to acquire enough energy to break\ndown;\n– a second step, which is the reverse of the first step, which deactivates the\nmolecule by a collision with another A molecule:\n(1)\n\n*\nA A A  A [10.R2a]\n\n(2)\n– the third step is the decomposition of the activated molecule to give the\nproducts of the reaction, B and C:\n* (3)\nA BC [10.R2b]\nThis set of steps is then treated according to the classical part of the pseudo-\nsteady state (here a quasi-steady state) by writing the balance of activated molecules\nand eliminating it according to:\nd A *\n  k A 2 k AA * k A * 0 [10.60]\ndt 1 2   3 \nThe concentration of the activated molecule is then deduced:\n2\nk A\nA *\n\n1\n[10.61]\n \nk Ak\n2 3\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 245\nFrom this, the rate of decomposition is measured in the third step:\nk k\nA2\nv  v  3 1 [10.62]\n3\nk A  k\n2 3\nBy using low pressures (low reactant concentration), we can approximate\nk 2 Ak 3, which according to equation [10.53] leads to a second order reaction\nrate:\nv  v  k A2 [10.63]\n3 1\nIf a high pressure is used, the approximation k 2 Ak 3 is remembered,\nwhich results in a first order reaction rate:\nk A\nv  v  1 [10.64]\n3\nk\n2\nThis basic model allows us to satisfy the two required conditions. From this\nfundamental model that was originally used for the approximation of a simple\nmolecular collision between two rigid spherical molecules, authors have developed\nmodels intended to refine the development of the previous steps and remained\nwithin the scope of the mechanic collision postulate. Hence Hinshelwood explains\nhow the energy provided during the first collision is eventually transferred into the\nbond that will be broken. Slater had an interest in the third step, which models the\nfrequency of bonds breaking having acquired enough energy. These different\nderivations resulted in increasingly complicated equations showing the influence of\ntemperature over the reaction rate, for which sadly no experiments allow us to\ndistinguish from Arrhenius’ law and the different models.\nFor the sake of homogeneity, more time will be spent looking at how Eyring’s\nactivated complex theory, which is the only one able to give orders of magnitude to\nthe pre-exponential terms in the bimolecular reactions, deals with monomolecular\nreactions.\nThis time, the collision hypothesis is conserved in the energetic sense and\ninvolves two reactant molecules forming the activated complex, but the latter only\ncontains one molecule A, and the second molecule is used to transfer energy. The\ncrossing of the pass will therefore lead to the reaction product provided a\ntransmission coefficient exists. We will later return to this. Thus, the elementary\nreaction will be represented by:\n246 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nAA A ABC [10.R3]\nA mnemonic method is used to express the reaction rate coefficient (see Note\n10.1). This involves writing the “equilibrium” between the reactant and the activated\ncomplex, resulting in the constant being:\n \nA [A]\n \nK\n [10.65]\nc 2\n[A]\nThe volumic rate is then:\nαk T   αk T [A]2\nv  B A  B K [10.66]\nc\nh h [A]\nBy taking [10.65] into account and the definition of the equilibrium constant of\nthe activated complex using the complex partition functions of reactant A, as well as\nexcluding a degree of freedom of vibration and taking into account the energy\ncorrections at 0 K, the rate is defined as:\nαk T F  E \nv  B [A]exp a  [10.67]\nh F  RT \nA\nThe reaction rate is therefore proportional to the pressure (concentration of A)\ndespite a bimolecular collision, which implies that the activated complex does not\ninclude two particles from the collision.\nA first order monomolecular reaction has been reported here. Nothing from the\nequations obtained, however, allows us to predict that both first and second order\nreactions are limited to the high and low pressure respectively.\nIn the previous case, no particular attention was given to the transmission\ncoefficient, . This plays a very important role in monomolecular reactions. There\nare apparently two steps in reaction [10.R3]:\n– first, the activation process that involves the transfer of energy from the\ncollision into a vibration energy suitable for the bond to break;\n– second, the activated complex surmounting the barrier leading to the\ndecomposition reaction.\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 247\nConsequently, it is necessary to introduce a transmission coefficient into\nexpression [10.67]. It will have values that are lower than one unit and depend on\nthe pressure.\nThe transmission coefficient must be the same for the forward and reverse\nreaction (this vanishes in the equilibrium constant definition, which is the ratio of\ntwo rate coefficients). Useful information regarding  can therefore be deduced\nfrom the study of the reverse reaction. It has led authors to define the theoretical\ntransmission coefficient as:\nα ν\nα  e e [10.68]\nk T\nB  α ν\ne e\nh\nIn this expression,  is the frequency of collisions between activated molecules\ne\nand normal molecules and  is the probability of deactivation after the collision,\ne\nwhich is considered independent from the pressure. Naturally,  is proportional to\ne\nthe gas pressure (the concentration of A):\n A [10.69]\ne\nSubstituting  into [10.68] and [10.69], we get:\ne\n k T F [A] 2  E \nv e B exp  a  [10.70]\nh F A k B T  A  RT \ne\nh\nWith high pressure, a first order reaction rate is obtained:\nk T F  E \nv  B Aexp a  [10.71]\nh F  RT \nA\nand at low pressure, we get a second order reaction rate:\nF  E \nv  α φ [A]2 exp a  [10.72]\ne\nF  RT \nA\n248 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThese results are valid for a decomposition reaction such as [10.R3]. In the case\nof an isomerization of the form:\n*\nAA A AB [10.R4]\nthere is only one molecule of product and the transmission coefficient no longer\ndepends on the pressure. Relation [10.58] would be valid whatever the value of this\nvariable. This has been observed in cis-trans isomerization.\n10.4. Photochemical elementary reactions\nPhotochemistry is the contribution of the energy needed, in the form of\nelectromagnetic radiation, for a reaction system to react.\nIn general, as for thermally-activated reactions, photochemical reactions are\ncomplex and distinct from the basic steps. In general, only one is photochemical and\nis called the primary act, the rest being conventional thermal steps.\nIn an experiment, the primary act is almost never separable from the other\nelementary steps.\nPhotochemical reactions are governed by two very old laws: a qualitative and a\nquantitative law.\n10.4.1. Grotthus–Draper quantitative law\nUnder this law a reaction can only be caused by radiation if it is absorbed by a\nmolecule. This law reflects the need for interaction between the wave and the\nmolecule. If the absorption of light is necessary, this law is not broad enough\nbecause radiation can be absorbed without causing a chemical change.\nThe development of photochemistry is actually closely connected to the\ninterpretation of the spectra of light absorption by molecules, which explains\nwhether absorption causes a chemical change or not.\nFirst, qualitatively it is clear that radiation with greater energy will have a higher\nchance of causing a reaction, which is to say that in relation [10.73] its frequency is\ngreater or its wavelength is smaller according to [10.74]:\nE  N hν\na [10.73]\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 249\n118\nE  kJ [10.74]\n()\nDomain Wavelength Energy\nExtreme red  = 0.8  148 kJ\nExtreme violet  = 0.4  297 kJ\nUltraviolet  = 0.284  418 kJ\nTable 10.1. Energies matching visible and ultraviolet wavelengths\n10.4.2. Energetic paths of molecule dissociation\nWith spectroscopy, there are three distinct paths of molecule dissociation.\n10.4.2.1. Molecule dissociation by vibration\nIf we consider the energy curve of a bi-atomic molecule (curve I in Figure 10.1),\nthe absorption of energy has the effect of increasing the vibratory state to reach the\ndissociation energy. The series of different vibrational states, their limit and\ndissociation of the molecule are manifested spectrally by a succession of bands of\nincreasing closeness, each corresponding to a vibrational state up to a limit\ncorresponding to the dissociation of the molecule. Any excess energy supplied to the\nmolecule is lost as unquantified kinetic energy, hence a continuous spectrum.\n10.4.2.2. Molecule dissociation by electronic transition\nFigure 10.10a shows the operation of such a process. The starting point is\nrepresented by point M. The molecule receives energy which brings the\nrepresentative point to N which is located on a new Morse’s curve corresponding to\na more excited electronic state and at a height greater than the dissociation limit in\nthis state.\n10.4.2.3. Molecule dissociation by pre-dissociation\nFigure 10.10b represents such a case. The energy input is the representative point\nin N that lies on a curve of attraction of a higher electronic level S, which is the\nrepulsion curve type II in Figure 10.1, whose point is above the dissociation energy.\nThe molecule is dissociated after returning to its ground state along curve II. Such a\npre-dissociation has been suggested in the case of the dissociation of nitric oxide\n(NO) into atoms.\n250 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nNOTE 10.2.– A molecule entering an electronically excited state becomes highly\nunstable and the probability that the system will directly return to its normal state\nfollowing path NM of Figure 10.10b becomes high. This results in transmission\nfactor  having extremely low values in the order of 10-5 to 10-8 in the reaction rate\nequation, in comparison to the value 0.5 that we took for thermal reactions.\nFigure 10.10. a) Dissociation by passing through the activated state;\nand b) pre-dissociation via the repulsion curve\n10.4.3. Einstein’s quantitative law\nIn a primary photochemical act there are as many broken down molecules as\nthere are absorbed photons, which mean that the primary act can be written as:\nABhν  A B\n[10.R5]\nWarning: this law is only true for the reaction in the direction from left to right.\nIf the reverse reaction is significant or the transmission factor is low there will not\nbe as many molecules of AB broken down as there will be photons absorbed. It is\nsaid that the quantum yield is less than one because it is the ratio of broken down AB\nmolecules over the number of photons absorbed.\nThe fact that the quantum yield is smaller or larger than one provides important\ninformation on the mechanism. We have already seen factors that diminish the\nquantum yield. Other factors promote its increase. Reactions of high quantum yield\nare always exothermic reactions and are responsible for the discovery of chain\nreactions. Indeed, if the photochemicals act is the initiation step in the chain, as is\nmost often the case, the amount of product that has reacted following the absorption\nof one photon can be considerable. These reactions can achieve quantum efficiencies\nActivated Complex in the Gas Phase 251\nof several orders of magnitude, such as the photochemical action of hydrogen and\nchlorine in which the quantum yield is about 100,000.\n10.4.4. Influence of temperature on photochemical reactions\nThe influence of temperature on photochemical reaction rates can be very\ndifferent depending on the type of reaction, almost always following the same order\nof magnitude as the quantum yield. The primary act is never affected by temperature\nand thus the change of reaction rate with temperature is always due to other,\nthermal, steps of the mechanism.\nConsider first a reaction with simple, limited sequences. If the rate-determining\nstep is the primary photochemical act, usually the first step, and conditions are far\nfrom equilibrium, we will have a reaction with a quantum yield with units and a\nreaction rate that is not influenced by temperature.\nFor the same reaction, if we are close to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions\nthe quantum yield will be less than one and the influence of temperature will be felt\nby the term of distance from equilibrium (and lead to a negative influence of\ntemperature).\nIf we now consider the case of a reaction scheme in the pseudo-steady state\nmode but with no rate-determining step, such as a chain reaction far from\nequilibrium, the quantum yield will be high and the speed will obey a law given by\nthe complex application of Arrhenius’ law at every stage.\nNOTE 10.3.– The concentration of the reactants does not affect the rate of the\nphotochemical act, but this concentration is involved in the absorbed light intensity\nfollowing the Beer–Lambert law. The absorbed intensity is therefore:\nI I I I 1expKlAKl A [10.75]\n0 0 \nThus the reaction rate is proportional to the intensity absorbed and almost\nproportional to the concentration of absorbing species.\nThe modeling of the elementary act has been developed where gas phase\ninteractions between molecules are practically negligible. The modeling theory of an\nactivated complex, unlike the old theory of collisions, leads to the correct orders of\nmagnitude for pre-exponential factors of the rate coefficient and allows the\ncalculation of activation energy. It is indeed an absolute calculation of the reaction\nrate in the gas phase.\n252 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n10.5. The theory of activated complexes\nThe current concept of activated collision was developed in Eyring and Polanyi’s\n(see Figure 10.11) seminal work. Before this time, reaction rate calculations were\nbased on the classical mechanics of the collision of rigid spheres, which produced\nvalues that were much higher than experimental measurements.\nMichael Polanyi\nHenri Eyring\n(1899–1976)\n(1901–1981)\nFigure 10.11. Eyring and Polanyi developed the theory of activated complexes\nChapter 11\nModeling Elementary Reactions\nin Condensed Phase\nIn this chapter, we discuss the modeling of elementary steps in condensed liquids\nand solids as well as reactions located with the interphases. The aim is always to\nanalyze the elementary step and deduce an expression of the reactivity.\n11.1. Elementary reaction in the liquid phase\nIn the liquid phase, species involved in the elementary step can be neutral\nmolecules or other ions. In comparison with reactions occurring in the perfect gas,\nwhich we studied in Chapter 10, the fundamental difference is due to the\ninvolvement of interaction energy between molecules, molecules and ions and\nbetween ions, therefore modifying of the potential energy of every atom (or ion).\nFor reactions in solution, although we sense the influence of the solvent on the\nreaction rate, this influence does not appear to be caused by a possible deactivation\nfrom collision with solvent molecules because a similar number of collisions are\nable to activate molecules.\nReaction in solution will actually involve at least three steps that may be\nelementary:\n– the diffusion of reacting molecules (or ions) towards one another;\n– the actual chemical reaction between molecules with the formation of the\nactivated complex; and\n– diffusion of the molecules produced away from each other.\n254 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nDiffusion in a liquid can be treated as an elementary process requiring a specific\nactivation energy, but the magnitude of this energy (close to 20kJ/mol-1) is two to\nfive times lower than the level involved in the chemical act and therefore this\nchemical step is often much slower. Alongside the rate-determining modes of\ndiffusion or interface reaction, in many cases we encounter mixed pseudo-steady\nmodes that are treated classically.\n11.1.1. Generic expression of an elementary step reaction rate in the liquid phase:\nthe Brønstedt–Bjerrum law\nWith a bimolecular reaction between molecules A and B in the gas phase\ninvolving the activated complex M≠, we again consider expression [10.43], where\nV\n0\nb represents the volume associated with the activation reaction. For liquids we\nhave PV≠ = 0 and so:\n \nαk T  ΔG  αk T [M] αk T\nk  B exp  0   B  B K [11.1]\n  c\nh RT h [A][B] h\n \nThe true equilibrium constant is defined from the activities and is linked to the\none defined from concentrations\n(K\n) by the ratio of activity coefficients:\nc\nK\n\nM\n\n[M] ' M K  M\n[11.2]\nc\nA B [A][B]    \nA B A B\nIn this expression, │B│, is the activity of B and  is its activity coefficient,\n\nwhich is defined by:\nConcentration of B in the vapor in\nequilibrium with the solution at 1 atm\ng = [11.3]\nB Concentration of B in the solution\nBy combining [11.1] and [11.2], we get:\nαk T γ γ γ γ\nk  B K A B  k A B [11.4]\n0\nh γ γ\nM M\nModeling Elementary Reactions 255\nWhen considering solutions, it is often more convenient to take the pure solvent\nand an infinitely dilute solute reference since the corresponding activity coefficient\n' is defined by:\nB\nConcentration of B in the ideal solution\ng' = [11.5]\nB Concentration of B in the solution\n\nB\nand ’\nB\nare linked by the expression:\n ' [11.6]\nB B\nso equation [11.4] becomes:\n  ' '\nk k A B A B [11.7]\n0\n M ' M\nAfter review of [11.3] and [11.6], it is clear that  must be a constant for each\ni\nspecies at a given temperature and thus equation [11.7] can be written:\n' '\nk k' A B [11.8]\n0\n' M\nSince k’ does not depend on reactants A and B or the activated complex, this is a\n0\nconstant for a given reaction at a given temperature, independent of the nature of the\nmedium in which k is measured. For two different solvents, labeled I and II, we\ndeduce:\nk I  ' A ' B   ' M \n    [11.9]\nk II   ' M  \nI\n  ' A ' B  \nII\nNOTE 11.1.– It is possible to write this relation in another form by noticing the\n’ ratio between these two solvents, which according to [11.7] is equal to the ratio\nB\nof partial pressures of solute B in the vapors in equilibrium with the solutions. We\ndenote this ratio  and have:\nB\n256 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nk  \nI A B\n [11.10]\nk II  M\nIf we introduce the activity coefficient f defined by choosing the infinitively\nB\ndiluted solution as a reference, in the same way as above we can write:\nf f\nk k' s A B [11.11]\n0\nf M\ns\nk' is therefore the rate coefficient in the chosen solvent and at an infinite\n0\ndilution when every activity coefficient is in units. Equation [11.11] is known as the\nBrønstedt–Bjerrum law.\n11.1.2. Influence of the environment\nIt is clear that the influence of the species environment, such as the dielectric\nconstant of the medium, solvent used, etc., can be summarized as the influence of all\nthese variables on the activity coefficient. This returns us to the expression of the\nactivity coefficients in various types of solutions. Although the problem is fairly\neasy with reagents that are relatively stable compounds, it is more challenging with\nthe activated complex for which we do not have any means of measurement.\nActivity coefficients are likewise assessed using thermodynamics, either using\nMargulès or Wagner limited development, or by assessing the free molar enthalpy of\nthe component in excess using the following relation:\nGex =-RTlnγ [11.12]\ni i\nThe activated complex is much more dilute than the reactants and products. In\nmany cases, it is therefore possible to have reactions involving only neutral\nmolecules and establish that the activity coefficient of the activated complex within\nan infinitely dilute reference solution maintains a unit value.\nWe will illustrate the influence of the environment in both cases. First, we will\ncompare the reaction rate of the same reaction undertaken in the gas phase and in\nsolution. Second, we will look at the case involving reactions in sufficiently diluted\nionic solutes, by looking at the influence of both the dielectric constant of the\nModeling Elementary Reactions 257\nsolvent and the ionic strength of the medium for these diluted solutions. We will\nthen discuss the case of concentrated solutions.\n11.1.3. Comparison of the reaction rate in solution and gas phases\nIt is easy to compare the reaction rates obtained in both the gas phase and a given\nsolvent. By taking into account [11.4] and [10.39], the reaction rate factors ratio will\nbe given by:\nk liq k  A  B\n  [11.13]\nk gas k 0  M \nThe solubility s of a solute B of the gas phase in a solvent can be represented by\nB\nthe relation:\n ΔG  ΔS   ΔH \ns  exp B   exp B exp B \nB\n RT   T   RT \n[11.14]\n ΔH  1\n s0 exp B  \nB\n RT  \nB\nwhere ΔG , ΔS and ΔH are the dissolution Gibbs free enthalpy, entropy and\nB B B\nenthalpy respectively.\nUsing [11.13], we have:\nk liq  s M   s M 0  exp   H   [11.15]\nk s s s0s0  RT \ngaz A B A B  \nwith:\nH H  H H [11.16]\nM A B\n258 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIf, however, we write the reaction rate coefficients in a classic manner according\nto Arrhenius, we have:\nk A  E E \nliq liq liq gas\n exp  [11.17]\n \nk A RT\ngas gas  \nBy comparing [11.15] and [11.17], it appears that the difference in activation\nenergy in the liquid and gas phase is equivalent to\nH\n.\nWe frequently notice that\nH\nis nearly zero. In this case, the activation\nenergies in the gas phase and in solution are identical and the reaction rate\ncoefficient ratio according to [11.15] becomes:\nk\ns0\nliq\n\nM\n[11.18]\nk s s\ngas A B\nIn most of the gases, the entropic factor is within the order of 10-2 and the\nreaction rate in solution therefore appears 100 times more rapidly than in the gas\nphase:\nk\nliq 2\n10\nk\ngas\nIf the problem can be approached correctly with the reacting species (stables in\nsome conditions), however, this remains for the activated complex unless we\nimplement the intermediaries’ properties between the reactants and products of the\nreaction. Such an approach allows us to obtain interesting generic solutions. We will\nnow provide an overview of how to deal with dilute ionic solutions.\n11.1.4. Reactions between ions in diluted solution\nAs the activity coefficient of an ion in solution depends primarily on its charge, it\nis possible to use reasonable assumptions about the shape of the activated complex\nin order to estimate the activity coefficient more easily than for other types of\nreactions.\nModeling Elementary Reactions 259\nIn fact, each reactant is assimilated to a sphere, and two models have been\nproposed for a bimolecular reaction:\n– The bi-spherical model in which the activated complex is a double-sphere,\neach keeping the same charge as its origin molecule, the total charge of the activated\ncomplex remaining the same as those of the ions’ reactants.\n– The single-sphere model in which there is a fusion between the two spheres\ncorresponding to each reactant to generate one sphere carrying the sum of charges\nand of radius r M.\nCuriously, these two models lead to qualitatively similar conclusions. This\nproves again that the charge of ions is more important than their shape.\nWe will first express the partial molar Gibbs free energy and use relation [11.12],\nconsidering that this is the Gibbs free energy required for transferring an ion from a\nmedium dielectric constant unity (equal to 1) to that of the solution.\nHere:\n– zi: the electrovalence of ion, i (positive or negative); and\n–: the elementary charge.\nWe assume that the ion is first released in a vacuum (D = 1). After Born, the free\n2 2\n z\nenergy associated with it is . The radical obtained is transferred into the\n2r\nsolution of infinite dilution, thus there is an increase in the free energy ' due to the\nVan der Waals forces between the radical and its neighbors. The radical is then\nrecharged in a solution of a dielectric constant, D, and the associated free energy is\n2 2\n z\ni\n. During this last phase, polarization of the ion by charges would lead to a term\n2Dr\n'.\nThe total change of free energy for transferring one ion isolated from vacuum (or\nan infinitely diluted gas) to a solution of infinite dilution is therefore:\n2 2 2 2\n z  z\nF  i  i '\" [11.19]\n2r 2rD\n260 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThis quantity is clearly related to the activity coefficients . So, for an ion i, after\n[11.12] we shall have:\nlnβ  ε2z i 5   1 1   Φ β'  Φ β\" [11.20a]\ni\n2k Tr D  k T\nB i B\nConsequently we deduce the term:\n  2\nln β A β B  ε2   1 1   z A 2  z B 2  z A  z B   ΔΦ β [11.20b]\nβ  2k T D r r r   k T\nM B i  A B M  B\nIn a diluted solution, the coefficient of activity f (with the infinitely diluted\nsolution as a reference) is given by the Hückel model (by adding the non-\nelectrostatic term ):\nf\nBε2z2 Φ\nln f   i . f [11.21]\ni\n2Dk T k T\nB i B\nIn this expression, B is given by:\n8πN ε2\nB2  a μ [11.22]\n1000Dk T\nB\nwhere  is the ionic strength of the medium defined by:\nA z 2 [11.23]\ni i\ni\nwhich is the sum including all the ions present in solution. Using [11.21], we can\ntherefore deduce:\nf f ε2z z ΔΦ\nln A B  A B  f [11.24]\nf  Dk T k T\nM B B\nModeling Elementary Reactions 261\nUsing relation [11.7], we can write:\n  f f\nlnk lnk ln A B ln A B [11.25]\n0\n M f M\nfrom which we introduce [11.20] and [11.24] into [11.25]:\n  2\nε2  1  z2 z2 z  z\nlnk  lnk   1  A  B  A B \n0 2k T D r r r  \nB  A B M  [11.26]\nBε2z z ΔΦ\n A B \nDk T k T\nB B\nMoreover, by using relation [11.11], we can also write the Debye–Hückel model:\nBε2z z\nlnk  lnks  A B [11.27]\n0\nDk T\nB\nBy comparing both the two previous equations, we get:\n  2\nε2  1  z2 z2 z  z ΔΦ\nlnks   1  A  B  A B   [11.28]\n0 2k T D  r r r   k T\nB  A B M  B\nBy reporting this in [11.27] we get the following for the reaction rate coefficient:\ns\nlnk lnk 2Az z  [11.29]\n0 A B\nwhere A is a quantity defined by:\nN2ε2(2π)1/2\nA a [11.30]\n3/2\nDRT 1,000\n262 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFor A we calculate a value of about 0.51 in aqueous solutions at 25°C, and\nobtain:\ns\nlnk lnk z z  [11.31]\n0 A B\nThis relation gives a refined law between the logarithm of the reaction rate factor\nand the square root of the ionic strength. This law has been experimentally verified\nfor different reactions.\nTo calculate the influence of the dielectric constant, we use relation [11.26]\nextrapolated to zero ionic strength (or at B equal zero):\n dlnk  ε2  z2 z2  z  z 2\n 0    A  B  A B  [11.32]\nd(1/ D) 2k T r r r  \n  μ0 B  A B M \nFrom this relationship, we can show that if the initial A and B ions are oppositely\ncharged, the curve ln k versus 1/D (at zero ionic strength) is a straight line with a\n0\nnegative slope; whereas it is positive slope if the ions carry charges of the same sign.\nThis result is correctly found experimentally for the reaction between thiosulfate-\nbromoacetate ions in different aqueous solutions containing urea or glucose and\ncovering a range of dielectric constants from 20 to 140. The experimental points\ntowards zero ionic strength are aligned properly as a function of 1/D.\n11.1.5. Reactions in concentrated solutions: the acidity factor\nIn solvents with high dielectric constant, such as water, the solution deviates\nvery little from ideal solutions if they are diluted enough (about 0.1 M) and can be\ntreated using the Debye–Hückel model, as described in section 11.4.\nWith higher concentrations or solvents with lower dielectric constants, the\nsituation is much less clear. The deviation from the ideal can be significant and we\nno longer have a suitable model with a reasonable number of constants by which to\na priori calculate the reaction rate coefficient.\nAs a result of Hammet’s work, however, we realized that it was possible to\ncalculate the reaction rate coefficient of a reaction that is structurally similar by\nModeling Elementary Reactions 263\nmultiplying the latter by a compensation coefficient defined for a family of\nreactions.\n11.1.5.1. Influence of substituents on the reaction rate coefficient\nLet us write the reaction rate coefficient as:\n \nαk T  ΔG \nk  B exp  0  [11.33]\n \nh RT\n \nAt constant temperature we can then write:\n \nΔG\nlnk  const  0 [11.34]\nRT\nWhere  is an intensive variable such as pressure, electric field, etc., let us define\nthe following:\n \nΔG\n0  g [11.35]\nχ\nIn the hypothesis that the derivative [11.35] remains relatively constant over a\nwide interval of , we can write:\né¶Δ(G¹)ù\nΔ(G¹) = ê ê 0 ú ú dχ [11.36]\n0 T ê ¶χ ú\në û\nT\nEquation [11.34] then takes the following form:\ng¹\nlnk=const.- dχ [11.37]\nRT\nWe now imagine a group of reactions designated by the index (B) in which the\nsteps are basically the same and differ from each other only by the nature of the\n264 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\ngroup substitution. The measure , which might be the electric field in the reaction\nmedium, will be a series of particular values:\n(B) (B) (B) (B)\n , , ,...\n1 2 3 i\nThen for each reaction i of type (B), equation [11.37] can be written:\ng(B)\nlnk(B)  const  dχ(B) [11.38]\ni i\nRT\nNow consider a second family of reactions (D) undertaking the same group\nsubstitutions. The relation for this family of reactions corresponding to relation\n[11.37] will be:\ng(D)\nlnk(D)  const  dχ(D) [11.39]\ni i\nRT\nIf the two families of reactions (B) and (D) are not of very different types, for\nexample if they all involve the approach of molecules of the same signs, then the\n(B) (D)\nratio d /d is likely to be the same for all groups of substitutions. In many\ni i\ncases this ratio is indeed close to one unit.\nBy replacing this ratio with C in [11.38] and [11.39], we have:\ng(D)\n(B) (D)\nlnk C lnk [11.40]\ni g(B) i\nIf as we have admitted before, families (B) and (D) are fundamentally similar,\nthe influence of variable  on the Gibbs free energy of the reaction activation of type\n(B): g(B) is connected to the corresponding term for family (D): g≠ (D) such that\ng(D)\nthe ratio of these free enthalpies is nearly constant const.\ng(B)\nIn this case, equation [11.40] becomes:\n(B) (D)\nlnk  Xlnk [11.41]\ni i\nModeling Elementary Reactions 265\nIn this expression, X is a constant between the two types of reactions regardless\nof the substituent.\nFor a substitution group, this equation links the influence of the reaction rate for\na family of reactions (B) to the rate of reactions of another reaction family (D) with\nthe same substitution group.\n11.1.5.2. Rate coefficients and equilibrium constants\nInstead of comparing the influence of substitution groups on the reaction rates of\ntwo reactions, we can compare the effect of a group on the equilibrium constant and\nrate coefficient of the same reaction.\nFor example, we can compare the effects of modifying different groups, R, on\nthe rate coefficient of reaction [11.R1], with the influence of the same groups on the\nequilibrium constant of reaction [11.R2], which is the dissociation constant of acid\nR-COOH:\nR-CO-OCH + N(CH ) → R-COO- + N(CH ) + [11.R1]\n3 3 4 3 4\nR-COOH + H O = R-COO- + H O+ [11.R2]\n2 3\nThe variation of the equilibrium constant with the intensive variable  can be\nrepresented by an equation similar to [11.39], which is:\ng(D)\n(D) (D)\nlnK const dχ [11.42]\ni i\nRT\nIn this expression, g≠(D) equals the partial derivative of the Gibbs free energy of\nthe equilibrium studied with respect to variable  (by analogy with [11.36]). By\ni\n(B) (D)\nintroducing the same assumptions as before, which is that the ratio d /d is\ni i\na constant for a given group i, equations [11.38] and [11.42] allow us to write the\nfollowing:\ng(D)\n(B) (D)\nlnk C lnK [11.43]\ni g(B) i\nwhere g≠(D)/g≠(B) is a constant, the modification of free activation enthalpy by\npassing from one substituent to another is a defined ratio from the corresponding\n266 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nGibbs free energy modification of an equilibrium similar to the reaction. Hence, as\nbefore we will have:\n(B) (D)\nlnk  XlnK const [11.44]\ni i\nIt is possible to link the influence of a series of substituted groups on the\nequilibrium constant of two groups of reactions in a similar way. Here we obtain the\nfollowing equation:\n(B) (D)\nlnK  XlnK const [11.45]\ni i\nExperimental confirmations of equations [11.41], [11.44] and [11.45] are easily\nnoticeable in the literature through the numerous examples that are available.\n11.1.5.3. Example of the Hammet’s activity coefficient\nThe first to have introduced such a relationship is Hammet, through what is\ncalled the Hammet acidity function.\nTo introduce it, let us consider equilibrium [11.R3] between a neutral base B and\nits strong conjugated acid BH+ in aqueous solution:\nB + H+ = BH+ [11.R3]\nThe equilibrium constant K of the base is expressed as a function of activities\nB\nby:\nBH\n1\nK   [11.46]\nB\nB H K BH\nWe can express an activity by the product of concentration using corresponding\nactivity coefficient. Here, the constant becomes:\nBH\nK     BH . 1 [11.47]\nB\nB  B H \n \nH+\nModeling Elementary Reactions 267\nIf the base B (or its conjugate acid) is a color-indicator solution, the\nconcentration ratio of [BH+]/[B] is measured experimentally by the absorption of\nlight.\nThe value of this ratio is a measure of the tendency of the solution to transfer a\nproton to the neutral base B.\nFrom relation [11.47], we can deduce:\nBH\n  \nlog logK log B . H [11.48]\nB\nB \nBH\nIf we choose the infinitely diluted solution as the reference state for the activity\ncoefficients, the activity coefficients tend toward one in diluted solutions and\nequation [11.48] takes the simplest form:\nBH\n \nlog.H pK log [11.49]\n  B B\nHammett suggests that if the [H+] proton concentration measures the power of\nprotonation of the diluted solution, the corresponding term of relation [11.48] can be\nused in the case of concentrated solutions to measure the same property. Hence, he\ndefines the acidity function H of an acidic solution compared to a neutral base:\n0\nBH\n  \nH pK log log B . H [11.50]\n0 B\nB \nBH\nFor such a function to be really useful, it must be independent from the base, B,\nwhich is to say that the ratio  / should be the same for different bases. This\nB BH\nis observed for proximate bases that differ by the nature of the chemical group\nsubstituted.\n268 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFor such a family, we simply measure K in a diluted solution and the\nB\nconcentration ratio [BH+]/[B] in the concentrated solution to obtain the function H .\n0\nThe final model of the activated complex developed for gas phase reactions is\nperfectly suited to liquids and allows us to find the influence of parameters that\ncharacterize the environment, as in the case of reactions between ions, with the ionic\nstrength, dielectric constant and the role of the nature of the substituted groups in\nmore concentrated solutions.\nThis model can also be used with the process of diffusion, viscosity and\nconductivity of ionic liquid solution, which requires the correct modeling of the\nliquid state, built as a group of “holes” moving around the matter in the way that gas\nmolecules do in a vacuum.\n11.2. Elementary reaction in the solid state\nThere are relatively few elementary reactions in solid phase. The most common\ninvolve point defects whose source is the bulk and they do not require an interface to\nform, or the reactions of association of these defects. A particular mention should be\nmade of the displacement reaction of a point defect, which is the basis of the\ndiffusion process.\n11.2.1. Potential energy of a solid\nThe group of individual atoms, molecules or ions that make up a crystalline solid\nis arranged in space according to a periodic mesh called the crystallographic\nstructure of the solid. This structure is stabilized with regards to the group of\ncomponents separated from each other by attraction and repulsion energy terms,\nfunctions of the distances between the components. In the case of ionic solids, the\nattractive part of this energy is due to the electrostatic interaction between positive\nand negative ions.\nThe repulsive part of the lattice energy is due to repulsion between the electron\nclouds of ions when they come too close to each other. The superposition of both\ntypes of energy leads to an equilibrium distance between the ions and to a network\npotential energy with respect to the energy of the system when all the ions are at an\ninfinite distance from each other. For kinetic studies, it is convenient to take the\npotential energy of the lattice of an ideal solid as the origin of energies.\nModeling Elementary Reactions 269\n11.2.2. Reaction pathway\nIf a point defect (ion or ion vacancy) is introduced into the solid, its potential\nenergy will be changed from the one defining the previous ideal solid and the defect\nlocated at infinity. This new potential energy will depend on the position of the\ndefect in the solid. The point defect has a position of equilibrium in the system that\nwill keep the new potential energy at a minimum.\nTo illustrate this, let us consider a point defect consisting of an additional ion\nintroduced into the solid. As in the case of gas-phase molecules, we can plot a\npotential energy diagram giving the different levels as a function of, for example,\nthe position defined by the coordinates of the ion relative to a characteristic position\nof the lattice and forming the equilibrium position of the added ion. The diagram\ndefined therefore requires a 3D space in order to plot the iso-energy curves.\nTo simplify the plot, we only consider the motion in the plane consisting of\nequilibrium positions immediately adjacent and one ion between these positions. We\nthen construct a diagram similar to Figure 10.6. If we now consider displacement of\nthe ion in the plane (Figure 11.1), we obtain the potential energy curve as a function\nof the position of the ion.\nFigure 11.1. Displacement of an interstitial ion in the lattice\nThis curve can be represented in two forms, as shown in Figures 11.2a and\n11.2b. The first curve is symmetrical with the two successive equilibrium positions\nthat are identical; whereas in the second curve these positions are energetically\ndifferent. The first curve will be found in the bulk far from the solid walls and for\n270 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nlow defect concentrations. The second curve shows that at least one of these two\nconditions is not met.\nFigure 11.2. Variation of the system energy during a jump:\na) with two identical levels; b) with two different levels\nThe same results would be obtained if the defect consisted of a missing ion\ninstead of an added ion. This vacancy allows the movement of other ions. We prefer\nto take into account the displacement of the vacancy rather than the corresponding\nion, since the defect will still be considered an often-diluted vacancy solution in\nmany cases.\nFrom the previous energetic configuration (section 11.2.2), we deduced the\nnature of the elementary step within a solid. The elementary step is the jump of a\nparticle (or vacancy) from one equilibrium location to the nearest equilibrium\nlocation. In the case of solid, as with the activated collision of two molecules in a\ngaseous medium, it is no longer necessary to use the mass point analogy, since the\njumping particle analogy perfectly characterizes the process and creates the reaction\npath.\n11.2.3. Rate of an elementary jump\nTo calculate the rate of the jump, we can fully adopt the same logic as in Chapter\n10. If we choose to represent the reactivity of the elementary step as a function of\nthe concentration [] in default at the initial position, we have:\nφ=k[δ] [11.51]\nModeling Elementary Reactions 271\nThus we can use relation [10.39]. The coefficient ½ is justified in the case of\nenergetic equivalence at the starting and arrival points:\nk= k 2 B h T K c ¹ = k 2 B h T exp ç ç ç ç çè æ - (D R G T 0 ¹) ø ö ÷ ÷ ÷ ÷ ÷÷ [11.52]\nOur defect is considered in the same way in the solid as in the solution, so we\ncan apply the same changes to the model if the solution is not pure. The only\ndifference is that in our case the constant k, which is related to the concentration, is\ndefined directly from the diluted solution rather than the mixture in the gas.\nIn the case of solid phases we prefer to use the reactivity per unit of area of the\nplane perpendicular to the path of reaction instead of the volume reactivity. We\neasily pass from one to another by multiplying the previous rate coefficient by the\ndistance between the planes, which is of the same order of magnitude as the lattice\nparameter.\nWe therefore use relation [10.22] in both area and volume, the rate coefficient\nbeing a coefficient as appropriate per unit area and surface reactivity or per unit of\nvolume and volume reactivity.\nFor the activation energy, we can use relation [10.49] and write:\n \ndlnk 1 ΔU E\n  0  a [11.53]\nT T RT2 RT2\nIn the case of a reaction with a solid, the change in volume activation is near zero\nand [11.53] is written:\n \nE  RT  Δ H [11.54]\na 0\nIn general, given the characteristics of the Arrhenius coordinates and the low\ntemperature ranges covered for the same reaction, the temperature dependence of the\nactivation energy is negligible.\n272 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n11.2.4. Diffusion in solids\nDiffusion is often a determining process of a mechanism. It cannot be modeled\nby a single step but through a succession of jumps from a starting interface or\ninterface “0” to an incoming interface or interface “X”.\nWe will determine the diffusion flux of the defect M in one direction, in the case\nof diffusion through a thick plate X. The number of jumps is given by the number of\nplanes between the departure and arrival, hence n = X/a.\nBetween planes i and i + 1, the flux from left to right (see Figure 11.3) is given\nby applying [11.51] and [11.52]:\n \nak T  ΔG \nJ  B M exp 0 i [11.55]\ni 2h i  RT \n \nIn the opposite direction, the flux will be:\n \nak T  ΔG \nJ  B M exp   0 i [11.56]\ni1 2h i1  RT \n \nFigure 11.3. Schematic representation of jumps in a unidirectional diffusion\nModeling Elementary Reactions 273\nThe resulting flux between planes i and i + 1 will be given by the difference\nbetween the two previous fluxes:\n \nak T  ΔG \nJ  B M  M exp   0 i [11.57]\ni 2h i i1  RT \n \nAccording to the formula of finite increments, the concentration at i + 1 is given\naccording to:\nM\nM M a  [11.58]\ni1 i\n\nx\n\ni\nBy incorporating this into [11.57], we get:\n \na2k T  M   ΔG \nJ i   2h B    x i    exp    RT 0 i   [11.59]\ni  \nWe define a diffusion coefficient of plane i by:\n \na2k T  ΔG \nD  B exp   0 i [11.60]\ni 2h  RT \n \nThe flux at plane i will be:\nM \nJ D  i  [11.61]\ni i x \n \ni\nThis last equation is the Fick’s first law for unidirectional diffusion.\n274 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe will now consider the pseudo-steady state mode for diffusion through a plate\nof thickness Y and a constant unit section. To do so, we write that the variation in the\namount of diffusing species on plane i is zero, so:\nM\ni J J 0 [11.62]\ni1 i\nx\nGradually, as the diffusion section is constant, we deduce that the flux is\nindependent of the plane, so:\nJ J ...J J ... [11.63]\n1 2 i1 i\nThis flux is therefore:\n  G \nJ  ak B T M M  exp    0  i  [11.64]\n2h i i1  RT \n \n \nThe concentrations at the interfaces with borders 0 and Y are denoted [M] and\n0\n[M] . We assume that these concentrations are independent of time. From what\nY\nprecedes, we can write the following group of relations:\n G \n2h  0  \nM M  exp 1\n0 1 ak T  RT \nB  \n \n…\n G \nM M \n2h\nexp\n 0  i\ni i1 ak T  RT \nB  \n \n…\nDG \n2h  0  \nM M  exp n\nn X ak T  RT \nB  \n \nModeling Elementary Reactions 275\nBy adding the previous equalities, we obtain:\nak T M M \nJ  B 0 Y [11.65]\n \n2h n  ΔG \nexp  0 i\n RT \n1  \nThe application of this relation requires knowledge of the free activation\nenthalpies. In the case of Figure 11.3, and in general with diffusion, all the\nequilibrium positions are equivalent and therefore the activation energy is\nindependent of the x-axis. Moreover, at the solid state the activation entropy can be\nneglected and so the flux can be written:\na2k T M M   E \nJ  B 0 Y exp D  [11.66]\n2h Y  RT \nThe new expression of the diffusion coefficient, which is now independent of the\nx-axis, becomes:\na2k T  E \nD  B exp D  [11.67]\n2h  RT \nWe again find the expression of the flux in the pseudo-steady state mode:\nX X \n0 Y\nJ D [11.68]\nY\nThis expression is very important because it allows us to replace a group of\nelementary diffusion steps by a single step that can be formally considered basic and\nis written by distinguishing two different components of the same species X: X\n0\nat\nthe starting point and X at the diffusion finishing point. This new “elementary step”\nY\nwill be:\nX  X\n0 Y\n276 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n11.3. Interphase reactions\nInterphase reactions are of great importance in heterogeneous kinetics and\ninclude a number of physical processes, such as dissolution. We will classify these\nreactions based on the type of interphase.\n11.3.1. Gas–solid interphases: adsorption, desorption\nAdsorption and desorption processes are the reverse of each other and are always\nconsidered as occurring, whatever the nature of the solid and gas. During chemical\ntransformations there is chemisorption. When this double process occurs as steps of\na reaction mechanism, the Langmuir mechanism is satisfied.\nIt is possible to plot the equipotential curves of the system and therefore\ndetermine the activation energy and activated complex. Let us have a look at the\nexample of hydrogen adsorption on sodium. We consider all four atoms (presumed\nto be coplanar) of the hydrogen molecule parallel to the metal surface (the position\nof minimum energy) and the two sodium atoms that face it (see Figure 11.4a). Using\nmethods described in section 10.1, we can calculate the energy of this group for the\ndistance between each hydrogen atom and between the gas molecule and the metal\nsurface, assuming a fixed distance d between the two sodium atoms.\nFigure 11.4. Adsorption of dihydrogen on sodium: a) a four-atom system; and b) the\napproach and dissociation of a dihydrogen molecule\nUsing the calculated energies, we plot every equipotential curve in the axis\nsystem chosen (see Figure 11.5). Starting from the initial state of the gas molecule\nModeling Elementary Reactions 277\n(on the right of the diagram) to an infinite distance from the metal surface, we\nfollow the potential valley, cross the pass and reach the final position of the\nhydrogen adsorbed on metal. This defines the reaction path. If we now represent the\ndihydrogen molecule approaching the surface, we find that the molecule moves\ncloser to the surface. Two atoms then depart to find their equilibrium position\nfurther from the surface than the activated complex (see Figure 11.4b).\nFigure 11.5. Equipotential surfaces during dihydrogen adsorption\n11.3.2. Solid–solid interface: the concept of epitaxy\nInterface reactions between two solid transfer reactions are sometimes\naccompanied by the construction or destruction of a crystal lattice.\n278 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIt has been known for a long time that two crystalline solids, one which of starts\nat the surface of the other, often show mutual orientation relationships: this is the\nprocess of epitaxy. Studies such as thin layers of oxides formed by oxidation of a\nmetal, for example, have shown such a process. Figure 11.6 shows the example of\nthe schematic orientations of cubic iron oxide (FeO) formed on the 001 side of the\ncubic iron. The side of the iron oxide cube is 2.86 Å. The parameter of FeO is 4.29\nÅ. In the isolated crystal, FeO iron atoms are spaced at 4.29/ 2 3.89 Å intervals,\nresulting in a slight deformation of the iron oxide crystal. If the layer of FeO is thick,\nthe defect fades away from the interface; the oxide has found its own structure.\nFigure 11.6. Epitaxy of the iron oxide onto iron\nThe process of epitaxy with the constraints it generates in the layers can explain\nthe delamination of some of the layers as well as cracks forming in the layer.\nIn the same case where an epitaxial layer is not detected, its existence is\nproposed as the basic hypothesis.\nThe epitaxial relationship that ensures the continuity of the network will allow\nparticles such as atoms, ions, and electrons to jump from one solid to another. It will\nlikewise lead to a jump within the same solid. Beside this, the energy levels of the\nstart and finish positions of the jump have no reason to be identical. It is the last\nproperty that will lead to changing vocabulary following diffusion, which is a\nsuccession of elementary steps that are all identical and continue with a jump across\nthe interface. This latter jump will is seen as a reaction but we see that modeling is\nequivalent to that which we have developed within the solids.\nModeling Elementary Reactions 279\nFigure 11.7 shows the pattern of jumps of the interfacial reaction between a\nmetal and an atom of G in an interstitial position of the compound GM, which\ncorresponds to the reaction:\n'\nG M G M\ni metal G M [11.R4]\nFigure 11.7. Interface reaction between a metal atom\nand an interstitial atom G\nThis reaction takes place in two elementary steps. In the first step, an electron\njumps from the metal on the interstitial atom, which creates an interstitial anion as\nwell as an anion vacancy at the interface and a new structure unit of the product MG\n(step a→b, Figure 11.7). In second step (b→c) the interstitial ion jumps into the\nvacancy that completes the structure element:\nG ' e'G ' M V\ni i M G [11.R4a]\n280 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nV G ' M G M [11.R4b]\nG G metal G M\nIn a pseudo-steady state mode, we show that the rate of the interface reaction is\nwritten formally as if it is elementary:\nk'G k'' [11.69]\ni\nwhere k 'and k'' are rate pseudo-coefficients. We can show that with a pseudo-steady\nstate mode, these coefficients are related to the reaction rate coefficients of the two\nelementary steps that constitute the interface reaction by the relations:\nk' k' k'' k''\nk' 1 2 and k'' 1 2 [11.70]\nk' k' k'' k''\n2 1 2 1\nNOTE 11.2.– A review of relations [11.70] shows that if the rate coefficients of\nelementary steps follow Arrhenius’ law with temperature. The apparent rate\ncoefficient will do unless one of the denominator terms is negligible compared to the\nother, which is often the case of the jump of the ion compared with the jump of the\nelectron.\n11.4. Electrochemical reactions\nElectrochemical reactions make up a specific family of interface reactions. These\nare described and analyzed in Chapter 3, section 3.4.\n11.4.1. Definition\nAn elementary electrochemical reaction is a redox reaction occurring at the\ninterface between an electron-conducting solid, called the electrode, and a solution\nof ions, called the bath or electrolyte solution.\nSuch a reaction can be written in one of the following forms:\n A e B\nA e B [11.R5]\nModeling Elementary Reactions 281\n Oxy e Red [11.R6]\noxy e red\nor:\n A  e0\ni i e [11.R7]\nThe coefficients then make sense of algebraic stoichiometric coefficients. This\nreaction may take place in one direction or another.\nNOTE 11.3.– The electrode can be either a metal (or carbon) or a semiconductor.\nThe electrolyte can be either an ionic liquid or an ion-conducting solid.\nThermodynamics tells us that when no current passes through the electrode,\nthere is a potential called the potential drop e , often given by the Nernst equation:\ni=0\ne . If a current now passes through the system, an electrochemical reaction takes\nth\nplace at the electrode and it has a potential, e, that is different from that of the\npotential drop. The electrode is therefore polarized. The potential difference\n(positive or negative):\nE ee [11.71]\ni0\nis called the polarization.\nIf the potential drop is the Nernst thermodynamic potential:\nee [11.72]\nth\nthe polarization is called an overpotential.\n11.4.2. Reactivity of an electrochemical reaction\nThe classic definition of reactivity can be applied to an electrochemical reaction\nand we can therefore write it considering the number of electrons dne consumed\nbetween instants t and t + dt. The interface area being bi-dimensional, we often use\nthe surface reactivity. We have:\n282 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n1 dn\ne\n [11.73]\nS dt\ne\nor the number of electrons per unit of time is proportional to the current intensity I,\nwe call it the current density i. This is the intensity per unit of surface.\nCONVENTION 11.1.– In electrochemistry, intensities corresponding to an\noxidation are counted positively, and those corresponding to a reduction are counted\nnegatively.\nIf  e is taken as an absolute value and F denotes the Faraday, the reactivities of\noxidation and reduction will be:\nI i I i\n   and    [11.74]\noxy red\nS eF  eF S eF  eF\nrespectively. Thus, the surface reactivity of an electrochemical reaction is the\ncurrent density (to the nearest coefficient).\n11.4.3. The De Donder–Pourbaix inequality\nAccording to the De Donder inequality, the product of the affinity of a reaction\nand its rate is positive or zero. When transposed to electrochemical reactions, the\ninequality becomes:\n.i0 [11.75]\nThus, according to the agreement above, an electrochemical reaction can only\ntake place in the direction of oxidation if the overpotential is positive and in the\ndirection of a reduction if the overpotential is negative.\n11.4.4. Polarization curves\nAmong the various parameters that may affect the reactivity of an\nelectrochemical reaction (the current density), one of the most important is the\npotential e at the electrode, which is ultimately the difference at the equilibrium.\nModeling Elementary Reactions 283\n11.4.4.1. Definition\nWe will be informed about an electrochemical reaction by studying the influence\nof the potential. To do this, we draw the curves e(i) that are the polarization curves\ncorresponding to the reaction being considered. Curves(i) are also called\npolarization curves. They differ from the previous ones by a translation, and pass\nthrough the origin (if i = 0, the overpotential is zero because the electrode potential\nis equal to the thermodynamic potential e ).\nth\n11.4.4.2. Obtaining polarization curves\nIt is always difficult to obtain a polarization curve because we must avoid\npotential parasites that can appear in different parts of the circuit, particularly in the\nvicinity of the electrode.\nThe schematic diagram is given in Figure 11.8. A potential difference is\nestablished between the electrode studied (ET), also known as the working\nelectrode, and the counter-electrode (CE), which is arranged so that the current\ndensity on the working electrode is as uniform as possible.\nFigure 11.8. Potentiometric set-up to plot a polarization curve\n284 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe electrode potential is measured relative to a reference electrode (REF) using\nan electronic voltmeter with very high impedance, which is working with a current\nclose to zero. Measurement of the potential in the vicinity of the electrode is\nperformed by a capillary tube extending from a siphon of the reference electrode.\nPolarization of the electrode can be achieved using three different set-ups:\n– the potentiometric set-up as shown in Figure 11.10;\n– the intensiostatic set-up, where the intensity I passing through the electrode is\nimposed; and\n– the potentiostat set-up, in which the voltage of the electrode is at a fixed value.\n11.4.4.3. The shapes of polarization curves\nThe polarization curves resulting from inequality [11.75] and at coordinates (,i)\nare located entirely in the first and third quadrants of the plane. The gradient\n(de/di) is always positive at equilibrium.\ni=0\nFigure 11.9. Different types of polarization curves\nModeling Elementary Reactions 285\nOn the other hand, as the curve actually represents the reactivity of the\nelectrochemical reaction, its pace will depend on the reactivity. We therefore\ndistinguish three cases:\n– The reaction is fast in both directions: the system is often called quasi-\nreversible. With a low voltage positive or negative enough to cause the passage of a\nlarge current, the gradient of the curve at the origin (de/di) is low. Where the\ni=0\nreaction is infinitely fast, the system is always at equilibrium and the polarization\ncurve is horizontal (see Figure 11.9a).\n– The reaction is slow in both directions. On each side of the balance voltage, a\nminimum overvoltage  is required to pass a detectable current (see Figure 11.9b).\nm\n– The reaction is slow in one direction or is much slower in one direction than\nanother. Here there is a minimum cathodic (see Figure 11.9c1) or anodic (see Figure\n11.9c2) potential and the polarization curve is very asymmetrical.\n11.4.5. Polarization curve equation\nConsider an electrochemical equation written:\nOxy e Red [11.R8]\ne\nThis represents two opposite elementary reactions: a reduction toward the left,\nand an oxidation toward the right.\nThe total current density will therefore be the algebraic sum of two oxidation and\nreduction current densities:\nii i [11.76]\noxy red\nWe can apply the activated complex model to each of the elementary steps. We\nmust first define an activated complex of oxidation (Red≠) and the activated\ncomplex of reduction (Oxy≠). These two complexes are not identical since, as we\nwill see in Figure 11.10, the energetic pathways of these two opposing steps are not\nthe reverse of each other. The reactivities are written:\n286 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\ni k T\nφ  ox  B Red [11.77]\noxy ν eF h  \ni k T\nφ  red  B Oxy [11.78]\nred ν eF h  \nBy proceeding as we did and introducing the activation equilibrium constants,\nwe obtain:\ni  eF k B T  K  Red  K  Oxy  [11.79]\nOxy red\nh\nWe now consider the energy paths of these two opposing steps. In each of these\nreactions, the electron crosses a potential barrier  which is the absolute potential\nof the electrode. We can therefore calculate the Gibbs free energy of activation:\n \nΔG o  x  ΔG o  x chem  eF Δ [11.80]\n \nΔG\nr\n\ned\n ΔG\nr\n\ned chem\n eF Δ [11.81]\nFigure 11.10 shows the shape of the energy of the system as a function of the\nreaction path of each step.

The inflection point of the polarization curve\nthen coincides with the origin.\n290 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe results related to the reaction rates of the elementary steps can be introduced\ninto more complex systems, including one or more rate-determining electrochemical\nsteps as is the case for other types of elementary steps. Elementary electrochemical\nsteps can also be combined with thermal steps.\n11.5. Conclusion\nThe steps occurring in solid interface phases ultimately result from the same\nmodeling for the activated complex as with the reactions in homogeneous phases. In\nthis case, these steps are not activated collisions, however, but particle jumps. The\nuseful reactivities are therefore the surface reactivities written in mol/m-2s-1.\nChapter 12\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions\nIn this chapter, we will expand on the modeling of chain reactions, which are of\nconsiderable practical importance in the fields of polymer chemistry and\ncombustion, of molecules such as hydrocarbons for example, and explosions. Our\nstudy will examine the chain reactions that can lead to pseudo-steady state modes.\nThe extension to non-pseudo-steady state modes will be discussed in Chapter 15.\n12.1. Definition of a chain reaction\nA chain reaction is a reaction in which a small number of elementary steps are\nrepeated numerous times with the help of a small number of intermediate species\nthat are constantly formed and destroyed. The repetitive sequence is called a link in\nthe chain. The best known example is the reaction of hydrogen bromide synthesis,\naccording to reaction [12.R1], whose mechanism may be represented by steps\n[12.R1a] to [12.R1d]:\nBr + H = 2HBr [12.R1]\n2 2\nBr → 2Br [12.R1a]\n2\nBr + H → HBr + H [12.R1b]\n2\nH + Br → HBr + H [12.R1c]\n2\nBr + Br → Br [12.R1d]\n2\n292 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nBy extension, a chain reaction is also called a linear reaction, which consists of a\nlarge number of very similar steps. Thus, the polymerization and polycondensation\nreactions are also considered chain reactions, each step being very close to the\nprevious since it corresponds to the addition of a small entity to the molecular chain.\nAnother example of such a chain reaction consists of all the steps of solid nucleus\nformation from a liquid solution or a solid (see Chapter 14).\nIn homogeneous kinetics, chain reactions can be arranged into three large\ngroups:\n– reactions involving halogens or derivatives;\n– reactions of oxidation and combustion (hydrogen, hydrocarbons); and\n– reactions involving the formation of macromolecules (polymerizations and\npolycondensations).\n12.2. The kinetic characteristics of chain reactions\nChain reactions have characteristic rate–time curves (see Figure 12.1):\n– the initial rate is zero;\n– rates (see Figure 12.1) may lead to high values showing a maximum (curve 2)\nor to ignition or explosion in some areas of the pressure–temperature plane (curve 1\nand see sections 15.3 and 15.4); we frequently notice the important role of inhibitors\nand promoters;\n– we often notice the influence of the reactor surface–volume ratio on the\nreaction rate.\nFigure 12.1. The shape of the rate–time curves of a chain reaction\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 293\n12.3. Classification of chain reactions\nWe can distinguish three classes of chain reactions:\n– linear, straight chain or non-branch chain reactions;\n– reactions with direct branching; and\n– reactions with indirect branching.\n12.3.1. Straight or non-branched chain reactions\nIn such a reaction, the intermediate is called the active center and reacts with a\nreactant to give another active center having the same properties and final products\nas the previous one. The initial active center is formed by initiation and disappears\nwith the breaking reaction. From the perspective of an active center, the Semenov\ndiagram is linear (see Figure 12.2).\nInitiation Breaking\nX X X X… X\nFigure 12.2. Schematic representation of a linear chain reaction with\nonly one active center\nWith most generic cases, there are two alternating reactants and active centers, X\nand Y, as illustrated in Figure 12.3.\nX Y X X... Y\nor Y\nFigure 12.3. Schematic representation of a linear chain with two active centers\nWe define the number of chain links as follows. If an initial active center is\nresponsible for the formation of n active centers of the same type, the chain will\nhave n links. For example, Figure 12.4 shows the example of a chain with three\nlinks.\nInitiation Breaking\nX X X X\nFigure 12.4. Example of a linear chain with three links\n294 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe length of a chain is its number of links. In theory, in the reaction medium the\nlength of the chain varies from zero to infinity. In practice, short chains are\npredominant. The mean chain length will be the mean number of links susceptible to\nformation by only one active center. This is a statistical measure.\n12.3.2. Reactions with direct branching\nIn any step of the mechanism, if an active center gives rise to several active\ncenters, each giving rise to a chain, the reaction is said to have direct branching. The\nbranching process may be represented by:\nX → X [12.R2]\nwhere  is an integer greater than 1 (otherwise the reaction would be linear) and is\ncalled the chain multiplying factor.\nIn the example of hydrogen combustion, the branching diagram is:\nBranching H°+O OH°+O°° [12.R3a]\n2\nOH° +H H O+H°\n2 2\nPropagation  [12.R3b]\nO°°+H\n2\nOH°+H°\nWe see that each propagation link gives rise to two active centers – OH° and H°\n– hence the branching.\n12.3.3. Reactions with indirect branching\nWith these reactions, a chain is forming and gives rise not to the final reaction\nproducts but to intermediate products I, which are fairly stable and are at the origin\nof new active centers leading to the development of secondary chains. Such a chain\ntype has been suggested for heptane oxidation.\n  C 7 H 1 ° 5 +O 2 C 7 H 14 +HO° 2\nPropagation  [12.R4a]\nC\n7\nH\n16\n+HO°\n2\nC\n7\nH\n1\n°\n5\n+H\n2\nO\n2\nBranching H O +M2OH [12.R4b]\n2 2\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 295\n°\nNew propagationn C H +OH°C H +H O [12.R4c]\n7 16 7 15 2\nWe see that the chain grows because of HO and that the formation of H O ,\n2 2 2\nwhich is relatively more stable than HO , is at the origin of a new reaction.\n2\n12.4. Chain reaction sequences\nIn a chain reaction, we are led to distinguish four types of sequences:\n– chain initiation;\n– chain propagation;\n– chain breaking; and\n– chain branching.\nThe first three phases are necessary.\n12.4.1. Initiation of a chain reaction\nInitiation aims to form active centers that are called initiation centers. These will\noften be different from the propagation centers. Initiation centers are often radicals,\natoms, or ions.\nThe initiation reaction can be triggered by several factors:\n– heat (thermal initiation);\n– catalysis (catalytic initiation); and\n– light (photochemical initiation).\n12.4.1.1. Thermal initiation\nAn unstable substance under the control of heat is added to the reaction, which\nwill dissociate and produce free radicals. These are often molecules with weak\nbonds: peroxide compounds or di-nitrogen derivatives.\nFor example, benzoyl peroxide is a source of free radicals that work according to\nthe following:\nPh-CO-O-CO-Ph2Ph-CO-O\n [12.R5]\n Ph-CO-OPh°+CO 2\n296 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nSimilarly, with lead tetraacetate:\n(CH COO) Pb(CH COO) Pb+2CH COOH\n3 4 3 2 3\n [12.R6]\n\nCH\n3\nCOOHCH\n3\n°+CO\n2\nIt seems in fact that the frequency of these reactions is rather low in the bulk of\nthe reaction but frequent at the surface of the reactor walls.\nThe rate of an initiation sequence in volume units can have variable forms but is\noften proportional to the initiator concentration [In]:\nv  k In\ni [12.1]\n12.4.1.2. Catalytic initiation\nAlthough thermal initiation often leads to the formation of radicals and atoms,\ncatalytic initiation leads to the formation of ionic initiation centers. These centers are\nformed by the reaction of the reactant with the catalyzer.\nFor example, Friedel–Crafts reactions are catalyzed by Lewis acids (AlCl , BF ,\n3 3\netc.). The catalysis only acts during the initiation stage:\nRXAlCl AlCl X - R [12.R7]\n3 3\nThis reaction is elementary.\n12.4.1.3. Photochemical initiation\nIn this case, the initiation center is produced by the action of light at a suitable\nwavelength on an appropriate molecule (halogens, halides, ketones, etc.). The\nreaction is written:\nAhν A* [12.R8]\nThe rate per volume unit of such a reaction is generally proportional to the light\nintensity and rarely directly depends on the concentration of reactant A:\nvkI [12.2]\nPhotochemical initiation generally produces excited atoms or free radicals.\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 297\nIf the initiation stage includes several steps, the rate of initiation will be from the\nlast step, strictly speaking, but in the case of a pseudo-steady state initiation mode\nthe initiation rate can be the rate of any of the steps divided by its multiplying\ncoefficient.\n12.4.2. Propagation of a chain reaction\nThe propagation reaction often has the function of producing the products of the\nreaction, or at least to regeneration of the active centers. This is the most frequently\nrepeated stage during the reaction. Propagation reactions are classified in four\ncategories:\n– addition reactions:\nR  A  A  RA  A\n\n1 2 1 2\n R O\n2\n RO\n2 [12.R9]\n– decomposition reactions:\nR  A  A  R  A  A\n\n1 2 1 2\n C\n3\nH\n7\n  C\n3\nH\n6\n H\n[12.R10]\n– isomerization reactions:\n° °\ntR R [12.R11]\n1 2\n– transfer or substitution reactions:\n° °\nR R R R R R [12.R12]\n1 2 3 1 2 3\nIf the synthesis of the reaction product requires several steps, the propagation\nrate will be the rate of the last step. If the propagation sequence is in a pseudo-steady\nstate mode, the propagation rate is the rate from any step divided by its multiplying\ncoefficient.\nThe rate of disappearance of the reactants is the sum of the initiation and\npropagation rates. This is the propagation phase consuming the vast majority of the\nreactants (and that also synthesizes the majority of the products). The rate of\ninitiation will therefore be much lower than the rate of propagation, so that\n298 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\neventually the rate of reactants’ disappearance (or product synthesis) is almost equal\nto the rate of propagation:\nd[A]\n- =v +v @v [12.3]\ndt i p p\n12.4.3. Chain breaking\nBreaking reactions lead to the disappearance of active centers. Breaking can be\ncaused by:\n– a quadratic reaction between two identical or different active centers:\n° °\nR +Cl RCl [12.R13]\n– the reaction between an active center and impurities that act as inhibitors of the\nreaction. For free radicals, inhibitors are often with a free pair of electrons, such as\nO , NO , CO, etc.\n2 2\nBoth quadratic reactions and reactions between active centers and impurities\noccur in the reactor volume and are called “bulk breakings” as opposed to a type of\nbreaking that frequently occurs at the surface of the reactor walls, which\nconcentrates the active centers by adsorption.\n12.4.4. Branching chain reaction\nThe branching process is an essential step corresponding to the multiplication of\nactive centers. There are a huge number of branching reactions, such as simple linear\nbranching, for example:\n° ° ° °\nH +O OH +O [12.R14]\n2\nor indirect crossed reactions like:\n R AR' D\n [12.R15]\n\nDR 3R\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 299\n12.5. Kinetic study of straight chain or non-branch chain reactions\nThe modeling of straight chain reactions aims to determine the influence of the\ndifferent variables on the average length of the chains and the reaction rate. This\ntype of modeling was developed by Semenov.\n12.5.1. Mean length of the chains\nIn the reaction medium and at a given time, chains of variable length coexist.\nThese chains theatrically vary from one to an infinite number of links (even if the\nnumber of short chains is by far the largest, as we will see later). The mean length of\nthe chain will be the mean number of links able to generate an initial active center.\nThis is a statistical quantity.\nThere is no generic way to calculate of the mean length of a chain and therefore\nno general relation is applicable for any sort of straight chain reaction, whichever\nstructure this has. To calculate the mean length, we will study two specific cases that\nwill allow us to develop the Sochet’s method, which is a very generic application.\n12.5.1.1. Decomposition reaction by a single active center\nLet us first consider the chain reaction of the decomposition of reactant A. The\ninitiation step generates the active center X that will be reproduced at every link\n(even if the link can include several successive intermediate steps).  is the\nprobability an active center X will generate another active center by reaction with\nreactant A. The probability of this active center disappearing without expanding the\nchain will therefore be \n1 [12.4]\nWith the help of Table 12.1, let us summarize the active centers generated by the\ninitiating step.\nFormed chains Number of Probability p\nlinks n\nBreaking (term) 0 (1 – \nX→ Breaking 1  (1 – \nInitiation X→ X → term 2  (1 – \nX → X → X → term 3  (1 – \nTable 12.1. Calculation of the mean length of a chain\ninvolving only one reactant and one active center\n300 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nMultiplying each probability by the number of corresponding links and adding\nthe terms obtained, we obtain the total number of links, which is the mean length of\nthe chain:\n2 3 n\n1.(1)2. (1)3. (1)...n (1) [12.5]\nn\nFigure 12.5. Probability of having chains including n links with\n = 0.99 and =100\n(1)   n n    1 1 [12.6]\n1 \n1\nIn the case of long chains with low , we have Semenov’s relation:\n1\n [12.7]\n\nWe can therefore see that one active center can lead to the formation of chains\nwith  molecules of product and the disappearance of  molecules of reactant A. If\nn\nwe plot the curve giving the probability p  (1) of forming chains with n\nn\nlinks for a given value  versus n, we obtain the curve in Figure 12.5 with  = 100\n(or α = 0.99), which shows that short chains are by far the most probable.\n12.5.1.2. Reaction between two reactants with two alternated active centers\nWe now choose the case where we have two reactants, A and B, and two\nalternate active centers, X and Y. The two active centers are called alternates if the\none (X) results from the reaction of the other (Y) with one of the reactants (A or B)\nand vice versa. F and G are the final products obtained according to:\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 301\nX AY F [12.R16]\nY B X G [12.R17]\nNo. No.\nChain formed n p\nof F of G\nBreaking 0 0 0 (1 – \n\nY→ breaking 0    (1 –  \n \nInitiation X Y→ X→ breaking 1     (1 – \n  \nY→X→ Y→ breaking 1     (1 –  \n  \nY→X→Y→X→\n2      (1 – \nbreaking   \nY→X→Y→X→Y→\n2      (1 –  \nbreaking   \nTable 12.2. Calculation of the mean chain length with two reagents\nand two active centers\nWe see that the example of hydrogen bromide synthesis (see section 12.1)\ncorresponds to the case of F and G identical to two HBr.\nWe denote that  is the probability centre X will generate active center Y by\n1\nreaction [12.R16] and  is the probability center Y will generate active center X by\n2\nreaction [12.R17]. The opposite probabilities are therefore 1 –  = ,\n1 1\n1 –  =  , …. We assume that the initiation reaction results in the formation of\n2 2\nactive center X. As with the previous example, we build up the repertory of the\ndifferent chains that may form (see Table 12.2).\nThe formation of a link is obtained when the same active center is regenerated\n(e.g. between two X centers in our example) requiring two elementary steps. The\naverage length of a chain is then:\n1.   (1 ) 2  (1 )\n 1 2 1 1 2 2 \n[12.8]\n2.  2  2 (1 ) 3  2 (1 ) ...\n 1 2 1 1 2 2 \nwhich can be written:\n  1  .2 2  21  ...n n  n1   [12.9]\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n302 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nor finally:\n\n1    n n  n   1  2 [12.10]\n1 2 1 2\n1 \n1 1 2\nWe note that this result could have been deduced directly from Table 12.1 by\nremembering that the probability of passing from X to the next X is the product of\n  . We can generalize relation [12.7], which gives the mean length of a chain as\n1 2\nthe reverse of the breaking probability.\nThe development of Table 12.2 is justified if we want to study the formation of\nproducts F and G or the disappearance of reagents A and B.\nIn order to count the number of products formed, we have added the number of\nmolecules of F and G formed for each chain from an initial center (see Table 12.2).\nWe see that the number of G molecules formed is equal to the number of links or ..\nThe number of F molecules formed will be given by:\n\nF1   n n  n1   1   [12.11]\n1 2 1 2\n1  \n1 1 2 2\nIn the specific case where F and G are identical (e.g. in the case of HBr\n\nsynthesis), there is formation of  (HBr) molecules.\n\n2\n12.5.2. Expression of the reaction rate\nWe have seen that the reaction rate could almost be expressed as the propagation\nrate of the reaction (see relation [12.3]).\nWe can also express this rate in a pseudo-steady state mode, by writing that\nwhenever the active center is formed by initiation,  numbers of active centers\ndisappear.\nWe consider the case of a single reactant A and product B, and only one active\ncenter (as in Table 12.1). Each active center disappears during a reaction and has\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 303\ndestroyed  moles (or  + 1 or  + 2 moles, depending on the reactions of initiation\nand breaking or the absence of reactant A) of the reactant and produced  moles of\nthe final product. If the chains are long enough we will therefore have:\nv=ν.v [12.12]\ni\nIn the case of two reactants, A and B, two products, F and G, and two alternating\nactive centers (as in Table 12.2), an active center formed by initiation involves the\ndestruction of  molecules of B and / molecules of A. These active centers\n2\nlead to the production of  molecules of G and / molecules of F. The rate of\n2\nappearance or disappearance of these compounds is expressed with one of the two\nfollowing relations:\nv  ν.v\ni [12.13]\nν\nv  v [12.14]\ni\nα\n2\nThese expressions imply that the breaking reactions do not involve reactants and\nthe initiation reaction does not involve a reactant or, if any of these conditions is not\nmet, that the chains are long enough.\nWe thus have two ways to calculate the reaction rate, either by using relation\n[12.3] or by using any of the relationships [12.12] [12.13] or [12.14], as appropriate.\nNOTE 12.1.– In all our calculations, we have assumed that the stoichiometric\ncoefficients of the reactants and products were equal in the overall reaction. A basic\ncorrection is required if this was not the case.\n12.5.3. Calculation of the rate and mean length of chains in the reactor\nWe will now apply expressions [12.12], [12.13] and [12.14] to practical cases.\n12.5.3.1. Equation of the rate in a reactor\nWe will consider a linear chain reaction with a single active center, presenting an\neven initiation rate v in the volume of the reactor, first order breaking in the volume\ni\nin relation to the active centers, and breaking on the external walls.\n304 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n[X]\n0\nx d\nFigure 12.6. Semi-reactors between two planes\nWe choose a very simple closed reactor made of two plane walls of area S that\nare 2d apart (see Figure 12.6) and we assume that the breaking reaction is occurring\non the walls alone. We can apply the intermediate X balance in a constant volume\nfor the point x of the x-axis, to express the variation in the active center\nconcentration at the x-axis point x between times t and t+dt, with f being the\nr\nbreaking reaction rate factor assumed to be first order with respect to the active\ncenter:\n\nX\n\n2X\n v  f X D [12.15]\nt i r x2\nIntegrating this equation would result in determining the concentration of active\ncenters at point x of the reactor for a time t. Integrating this concentration in the\nwhole reactor would lead to the total quantity of active centers X in the reactor\nas well as their average concentration X, given by:\nX\nX [12.16]\nd\nWe define the lifetime of an intermediate involved as a reactant in a reaction as\nthe ratio of the concentration of this intermediate over the reactivity of the step, \nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 305\nX X\n   [12.17]\n   f  X \nThis latter relative quantity for the propagation step p therefore allows us to\ncalculate the reaction rate by:\nX\nv  [12.18]\nΔ τ\np\nThe mean length of the chains is calculated using equation [12.12].\n12.5.3.2.

In our case, the reaction happens\nwithin a constant volume. The pseudo-steady state mode becomes a quasi-steady\nstate mode. This quasi-steadiness is translated using [12.19] by:\nd2X\nv  D [12.20]\ni dx2\nBy integrating between x = 0 with dX /dx  0 and x  d /2 with\n0\nX  0, we have:\nd/2\n[X]= 2 v D i æ ç ç ççè d 4 2 -x2 ÷ ÷ ÷ ÷ ö ø [12.21]\nThis means that we have a parabolic distribution of the active centers in the\nreactor, perpendicularly to its symmetric plane. The total number {X} of active\ncenters is therefore:\nd/2 v d3\nX  [X].dx  i [12.22]\n-d/2 12D\n306 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe average concentration of an active center will be given using equation\n[12.16]:\nv d2\n[X]  i [12.23]\n12D\nAfter [12.17], the rate for a pseudo-steady state mode is:\nv d2\nv  i [12.24]\n12DΔ\np\nThe diffusion coefficient of gas as a function of the pressure, the average speed\nof particles and the free mean path under atmospheric pressure are related by:\n c\nD 0 [12.25]\n3P\nOtherwise, the lifetime  of an active center is about the time interval between\np\ntwo collisions (ratio of the average free path  at the average speed of displacement\nc) multiplied by the average number of collisions q that are required for an active\ncenter to react, so:\nq q\n0\n   [12.26]\np\nc Pc\nThe reaction rate therefore becomes:\nv d2P2\nv  i\n4qλ2\n0 [12.27]\nand the mean chain length according to [12.12] is:\n2 2 2\nd d P\n  [12.28]\n12D\np\n4q\n0\n2\nThe reaction rate and the mean chain length are therefore both proportional to the\nsquare of the pressure and the width d of the reactor.\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 307\n12.5.3.3.

The expressions obtained have the same form with different\nnumerical coefficients, especially the variations of rate or length of chains as a\nfunction of the pressure when the reactor’s dimensions (radius) remain the same.\n310 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n12.5.4. Variation of reaction rate with temperature\nUsing expression [12.42] again, we can admit that the initiation step is often an\nelementary step and therefore obeys Arrhenius’ law with the temperature and\nactivation energy E , therefore:\na\n E \nv  v0 exp a  [12.43]\ni i\n RT \nWith regards to the average number q of collisions required for an active center\nto react, its reverse 1/q measures the probability that a reaction will occur at one\ncenter for each collision. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this probability must\nincrease with temperature following Arrhenius’ law with an activation energy B,\nwhich is nearly the activation energy of the propagation reaction, and therefore:\n1  B \n aexp  [12.44]\nq  RT \nAccording the kinetic theory of gases, the average free distribution  varies\n0\nproportionally to T3/2 and therefore this variation is negligible in comparison to the\nexponentials.\nBy incorporating [12.43] and [12.44] into [12.41], we get:\nv0ad2P2  E  B\nv   i exp \n4λ2  RT \n0 [12.45]\nThe reaction rate of non-branching-chain reactions therefore follows Arrhenius’\nlaw; the activation energy is the sum of the activation energies of the initiation and\npropagation steps.\n12.5.5. Permanency of the pseudo-steady state mode and reactant consumption\nWe have admitted that everything preceding the pseudo-steady state mode was\npermanently established. It is obvious that at the start of the reaction, there are no\nreactive centers and therefore the reaction occurs in a transient manner. This is\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 311\nobtained for the solutions to equation [12.15] or its specific cases. In practice, we\ncan see that the pseudo-steady state is quickly reached. We can experimentally\ndetermine at which instant the rate is independent of time and therefore see the\nappearance of the pseudo-steady state mode.\nAll the previous expressions were established by keeping the initiation rate\nindependent of time (by integration of equations [12.20], [12.22] and [12.29]). This\nis a correct approximation for the first instance of the reaction and before reaching\n10% of its full extent. We have also worked with constant reactant concentrations,\nas shown in the integration of equation [12.22] that was done by keeping the\nbreaking rate factor constant. The decreasing level of reactants is translated by a\ndecrease in the concentration of active centers, which is also the breaking of the\npseudo-steady state mode. This leads to the breaking rate decreasing rather than\nremaining independent of time, hence replacing curve I by curve II in Figure 12.7.\nMoreover, if we examine the rate in expression [12.42], we can see that the rate\nvaries with the squared value of the pressure. In the gas phase of a sealed reactor,\nthis pressure can be a function of the reaction extent, which does not remain\nconstant with time.\nv\nI\nII\nt\nFigure 12.7. Rate–time curve: I) without consumption of reactants; and II)\nwith consumption of reactants\n12.6. Kinetic study of chain reactions with direct branching\nBranching chain reactions are distinct from linear chain reactions because of the\npresence of another type of reaction step: the branching step. Hence, for an active\ncenter X there are three reaction possibilities, which are illustrated in Figure 12.8\nwith their corresponding  and  probabilities for the propagationbreaking, and\nbranching steps respectively:\n1 [12.46]\n312 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFigure 12.8. Reaction possibilities of an active center in a\nchain reaction with direct branching\nThe probability a chain will not break is (1 – ). The branching probability can\nbe expressed as:\n1  * [4.47]\nRelation [12.45] expresses the branching probability, which is the product of the\nprobability the chain will not break and the probability branching will occur\npreferentially instead of propagation. In other words, * is the probability of\nbranching for a breaking probability equal to zero (= 0). * is called the\nprobability of branching with a chain link since if * = 1 we have continuous\nbranching occurring on every link.\n12.6.1. Simplified representation of reactions with direct branching\nIf we represent a link in the chain by a dash, a linear chain reaction would be\nrepresented by broken line including as many dashes as links, hence  is the number\nof lines as shown in Figure 12.9.\nTermination\nInitiation\nFigure 12.9. Diagram of a linear chain reaction\nWith the same symbols, a branch chain reaction will then present several broken\nlines, as from time to time an active center can give rise to another chain, as shown\nin Figure 12.10.\nIf the branching occurs on every link, the reaction is called continued branching,\nas happens with hydrogen combustion, for example.\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 313\nTermination\nInitiation\nTermination\nTermination\nFigure 12.10. Example of a chain reaction with branching\nThe general diagram can be simplified if we notice that one active center can\ndisappear by a chain breaking reaction or by giving rise to an average number  of\nm\nactive centers. Here, we have the diagram in Figure 12.11.\nTermination\nInitiation\nX\nµ\nm\nX\nFigure 12.11. Simplified diagram of a chain reaction with direct branching\nEvery branch chain reaction is therefore a continuous branching (* = 1) for\nwhich the number of active centers is multiplied at every link by  . The probability\nm\nof branching is therefore written by taking [12.47] into account:\n1 [12.48]\nThe mean number of active centers formed from a single active center is\ncalculated from the probabilities of other, different elements. For example, if we\nconsider the reaction as in Figure 12.5, we have:\n 1.p .p [12.49]\nm XX XX\nIn fact, this result assumes that the branching X→X is done in one elementary\nstep. Generally, branching results from several elementary steps, as in the example\nof hydrogen combustion, so that it is possible to obtain 1, 2… – 1, or  numbers of\nactive centers. For chemical reactions,  is lower than or equal to three. Generally,\nwe have:\n\n 1.p 2.p ... .p ip [12.50]\nm XX X2X XX XiX\n1\n314 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nA more concise form of the branching chain reaction is obtained by gathering the\nbranching and breaking steps:\nX 'X [12.R14]\nwhere ' is the global multiplication factor of active centers. This is the average\nnumber of active centers formed by one active center.\nThis global factor is given by:\n' 1 [12.51]\nm\nIf the branching is continuous, we get:\n  [12.52]\nm\nand so:\n'1 [12.53]\nIf the branching is both continuous and permanent (  and 0), we have:\nm\n' [12.54]\n12.6.2. Mean chain lengths: condition of the appearance of a pseudo-steady state\nHere, we can consider the reaction in Figure 12.12. In the primary chain\n(horizontal), between the initiation and breaking of the active center, two events can\noccur:\n– X→X; or\n– X→X.\ngiven a probability equal to 1 – . This defines the length of the primary chain:\n1\n [12.55]\n\nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 315\nInitiation X X X X Breaking\n( µ - 1)\nFigure 12.12. Generic diagram of a chain reaction with direct branching\nFor each active center X, except the one that breaks ( –1), the number of\nsecondary chains can develop with a probability *. Since we have  active centers\n*\nof this type, (1)   secondary chains can be formed.\n*\nEach secondary chain that is  long leads to the formation of (1)   other\nchains that are  long. The process can be repeated for all these chains. The average\nlength is therefore:\n2\n' 1   *  1   * ...\n   \n[12.56]\nn\n 1   * ...\n \nor:\n\n' [12.57]\n11   *\nFor the series defined by the convergence of relation [12.57] we need to have:\n1   * 1 [12.58]\nWe notice that the mean length of the main chain is (1 – )/ and not 1/ since\nthis primary chain is made of links originating from the simple propagation and\nbranching. Thus by using [12.47] and [12.55], the convergence condition is\nexpressed by:\n1  [12.59]\nThis limit will set the threshold at which the pseudo-steady state mode is\nreachable (see section 15.4).\n316 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe mean length of the chain, ', is therefore meaningful if condition [12.59] is\nmet.\n12.6.3. Example of a chain reaction with both linear branching and breaking in\nthe bulk\nHere, we consider the example of a branching chain reaction with an initiation\nrate v, a linear branching rate ( 1)f X and a linear breaking in the bulk of\ni m ra\nspeed f X.\nr\nThe kinetic mechanism with reactant A and product P is the following:\nInitiation X [12.R18]\nBranching X A X P [12.R19]\nm\nBreaking X  [12.R20]\nThe change in the concentration of active centers is written:\ndX\n v μ 1f  f X\ni m ra r\ndt\n[12.60]\nIf we notice that f  and f , this equation becomes:\nr ra\ndX μ 1δβ\n v   m  X [12.61]\ni\ndt  Δτ \nUsing [12.51] and considering [12.53], we obtain:\ndX α'1\n v   X [12.62]\ni\ndt  Δτ \nThe Kinetics of Chain Reactions 317\nThe corresponding equations for [12.60], [12.61] and [12.62] can be written as:\nd[X]\n=v +φ[X] [12.63]\ndt i\nwhere  is the branching factor. The term  is the difference between two positive\nterms, hence it may have a positive or negative value. Depending on the case, it may\nor may not be possible to consider a pseudo-steady state mode, hence the critical\nvalue is 0.\nWe will now examine the solution obtained when  is negative. The solution for\na positive branching factor related to non-pseudo-steady state modes will be\ndescribed in Chapter 15, which is dedicated to such modes.\nThe solution of equation [12.63] is:\nv\nX  i  1exp   φt  [12.64]\nφ\nThe concentration of active centers X reaches a pseudo-steady state mode\nobtained using [12.64] with the time tending toward infinity:\nv\nX  i [12.65]\nst\nφ\nUsing equation [12.18], for the volumic rate of the reaction we calculate:\nX v\nv   i  1exp   φt  [12.66]\nΔτ φΔτ\np p\nthereby the concentration of product P formed by the branching step is:\nv   exp   φ t  1  \nP  i t    [12.67]\nφΔτ  φ φ\np  \nTo obtain a suitable graphic representation, we use dimensionless measures\ndenoted X and P.

Semenov and the kinetics of chain reactions\nSemenov (see Figure 12.14) carried out an exhaustive analysis of the application\nof chain theory to various reactions, especially combustion processes. He proposed\nthe theory of branching, discussed in this chapter, which led to an improved\nunderstanding of the phenomena associated with the induction periods of oxidation\nprocesses.\nFigure 12.14. Nikolai Semenov (1896-1986) won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1956\n\nChapter 13\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions\nCatalysis is the acceleration of a reaction by the addition of a component: the\ncatalyst.\nTo catalyze a reaction is to change its mechanism in order reduce its energy\nrequirements. In the simplest case of a reaction with a single rate-determining step,\nto catalyze is to replace this potentially slow step with another with a lower\nactivation energy that is therefore potentially faster.\nThere are two areas of catalysis based on whether the catalyst belongs to the\nsame phase as the main constituents or a separate phase (usually a solid). The first\ncase is essentially homogeneous catalysis in the liquid phase; the second is\nheterogeneous catalysis between gas reactions catalyzed by a solid.\nAt the end of a reaction, the catalyst is chemically reconstituted so it is the same\nas it was at the beginning of the reaction. This property implies that catalysis does\nnot change the thermodynamic state functions, such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs\nfree energy of the reaction, as well as the equilibrium constant.\nNOTE 13.1.– At the end of a reaction, in the case of heterogeneous catalysis the\ncatalyst may have significant textural differences with its initial state.\nEven though the catalyst is not consumed in the reaction, its quantity often plays\nan important role in the rate of the catalyzed reaction.\n324 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n13.1. Homogenous catalysis\nThe most common homogeneous catalysis reactions involve catalysis in solution.\nA very generic mechanism of homogeneous catalysis has been proposed by\nHerzfeld.\nConsider a reaction of the following form:\nABEF [13.R1]\nCatalyzed by a substance C, Herzfeld has proposed the following mechanism:\nAC  X X\n1 2 [13.R1a]\nX BEX\n1 3 [13.R1b]\nX X  FC\n2 3 [13.R1c]\nWe see that the sum of the three steps [13.R1a], [13.R1b] and [13.R1c] gives the\noverall reaction.\nIf the reaction state is determined by step [13.R1c], the first two steps are in\nequilibrium and therefore:\nK AC K X B\nX  1 and X  2 1 [13.1]\n2 X  3 E\n1\nHence the speed is:\ndF K K BC\nk X X k 1 2 [13.2]\ndt 3 2 3 3 E\nThe rate is first order with respect to a reactant and the catalyst. We notice an\norder that is –1 with respect to a product.\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 325\nWith a pseudo-steady state in general it is easy to show that the three steps have\nthe same reactivity and the volumic rate of disappearance of reactant A, which is\ngiven by \n1\nis far from the equilibrium:\ndA\n k A C [13.3]\n1\ndt\n13.1.1. Specific acid–base catalysis by H+ and OH- ions\nAn entire family of reactions is catalyzed by water ions. We will explore the\ncatalysis of H+ and OH- in the case of the hydrolysis of sucrose into d-glucose and d-\nfructose, which is written:\nC H O +H O=C H O +C H O\n12 22 11 2 6 12 6 6 12 6\n[13.R2]\nd glucose d fructose\nIt was found that the rate of this reaction was proportional to the concentration of\nprotons and sucrose as:\n+\nvk H O . [sucrose] [13.4]\nH 3\nComparing this with [13.3], we see that Herzfeld’s mechanism may be used.\nWe define an apparent rate coefficient k, so that the rate is written:\nvk. [sucrose] [13.5]\nIn most cases, the reaction can be catalyzed by both protons and OH- ions. In\nmany cases, the reaction also occurs with an appreciable rate in the absence of the\ncatalyst so that the apparent rate coefficient is the sum of three terms, as defined in:\n+ -\nk k k H O k OH [13.6]\n0 H 3 OH\nWith protonic solvents, the concentrations of protons and hydroxide ions are not\nindependent. If occurring in water solution, for example, we must respect the ionic\nproduct of water:\n+ -\nH O OH K [13.7]\n3 e\n326 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nso that the apparent rate coefficient takes the form:\nK\nk k k H O + k e [13.8]\n0 H 3 OH\n+\nH O\n3\nIf from [13.8] we plot the logarithm of the apparent rate coefficient as a function\nof pH, we obtain the curve in Figure 13.1.\n.\nFigure 13.1. Variation of the reaction rate coefficient with pH\nBoth slightly linear parts of the curve cross each other at a point on the x-axis:\nK k\nH O +  e OH [13.9]\n3\nmin k\nH\nor:\n1 k \npH min  pK e log OH  [13.10]\n2 k H \nThese two parts form straight lines with slopes of +1 and –1.\nIf k is very low, we have a specific catalysis H+, and the left arm of the curve\nOH\nis absent. On the other hand, if k is low, we have a specific catalysis OH- and the\nH\nright arm of the curve is absent.\nIn any case, we always try to be as far as possible from the lowest point of the\ncurve, which may require us to displace the minimum by changing the protonic\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 327\nsolvent. This is because it is shown from expressions [13.9] and [13.10] that the\nionic product of the solvent (Ke) is involved with the position of this minimum.\n13.1.2. Generic acid–base catalysis\nIf we consider the more generic Bronstedt’s definition of a base and acid,\nprotons and hydroxide ions do not have specific properties in comparison to other\nbases. For example, with an acid AH and its conjugated base A-, with generic acid–\nbase catalysis, the apparent rate coefficient will have the form:\n+ - -\nk k k H O k AH k OH k A\n0 H 3 AH OH A\n[13.11]\nacid form base form\nOn the other hand, if we use base B so that:\n+ +\nB +H O BOH+H O [13.R3]\n3 2\nthe reaction rate coefficient will be written:\n+ -\nk k k H O k BH k OH k B\n0 H 3 BH OH B\n[13.12]\nacid form base form\nTo determine whether catalysis is specific or generic, we undertake catalysis in\nthe presence of a buffer solution, adjusting the pH of the solution according to the\nHenderson’s equation:\nAH\nH O + K [13.13]\n3 a\n-\nA\nThe pH is fixed and the experiment is carried out using different concentrations\nof AH and A- respecting the ratio in [13.13]. We then have two cases:\n– if the reaction rate does not vary, this means that A- and AH concentrations do\nnot influence the reaction and the catalysis is specific to the protons and hydroxide\nions;\n– if the rate varies, this means that all the species influence the rate and that we\nare dealing with generic acid–base catalysis.\n328 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIn the latter case, we wish to determine the different rate coefficients k , k , k ,\n0 AH H\nk and k .\nOH A\nTo do this, we can write equation [13.11] so that:\nk k  AH k k q' [13.14]\n1 AH A\nand having:\n-\nA\nk k k H O k OH - and q' [13.15]\n1 0 H 3 OH\nAH\nk\nC\"\nC'\nk '\n1\nC'''\nk \"\n1\nk ' ' '\n1\nAH\nFigure 13.2. Determination of the different rate coefficients\nWe carry out three experiments using the three values q', q'' and q''' of the\nconcentrations ratio and report the value of the constant k calculated as a function of\nthe activity of AH. The three straight lines (see Figure 13.2) C', C'' and C''' allow us\nto calculate three different values for k' , k'' and k''' of k , which are the intercept\n1 1 1 1\nvalues, and the slope of the curves are the constants k and k .\nAH A\nMechanisms like the Herzfeld type can account for the different types of generic\nacid–base catalysis that are possible. For example, in the case of acid catalysis by an\nacid AH during the hydrolysis product SH leading to an isomer P:\nSH+H O=P+H O [13.R4]\n2 2\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 329\nHerzfeld’s mechanism can be written using the following three steps:\nSH+AH=HSH + +A - [13.R4a]\n+ +\nHSH +H O=P+H O [13.R4b]\n2 3\n- +\nA +H O = AH+H O [13.R4c]\n3 2\nNOTE 13.2.– In all the experiments involving ions in solution, it is recommended\nkeeping a ionic strength of the medium constant between the different experiments.\nTo do this, we systematically add a large amount of strong acid salt and strong base\nin the medium (potassium chloride, for example) so that the total ion concentration\nremains almost unchanged between experiments.\n13.1.3. Catalysis by Lewis acids\nAs we did by generalizing the specific acid–base catalysis specific to Bronstedt’s\ngeneric acid–base catalysis, we also have generic Lewis acid–base catalysis\ninvolving electron pairs. We are reminded that Lewis has generalized the acid–base\nconcept by noticing that a Bronstedt base was fixing a hydrogen ion through a pair\nof available electrons. For Lewis, a base is a molecule able to accept an electron pair\nand an acid has an electron pair available. This new definition allows us to consider\ngeneric catalytic acid–base reactions in a non-protonic medium.\nAs an example involving Lewis acid–base catalysis, we can cite the case of\nFriedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene hydrocarbons catalyzed by aluminum chloride,\nwhich is a Lewis acid. A four-step mechanism reports the results:\n– The first step involves the addition of alkyl halide to aluminum chloride, which\nis a Lewis acid. Giving the complex polarized addition, this step can be written:\nR-X + AlCl → R- + X--AlCl [13.R5a]\n3 3\n– Electrophilic attack of the benzene ring causes alkylation:\nH\nR- + X--AlCl 3 + H Z Z + (AlCl 3 X)-\nR\n[13.R5b]\n330 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n– This is followed by a deprotonation:\nH\nZ → R Z + H + [13.R5c]\nR\n– Finally there is regeneration of the catalyst:\n(AlCl X)- + H+ → AlCl + HX [13.R5d]\n3 3\nThe global reaction is:\nRX + C H Z = RC H Z + HX [13.R5]\n6 5 6 4\nWe adopt the pseudo-steady state mode with infinite rate coefficients for the two\nreverse reactions of the first step, which is therefore constantly at equilibrium, the\nother three steps being determining.\nAccording to the equilibrium of the first step, we have:\nRX AlCl \n3\nK  [13.16]\n1 RXAlCl \n3\nThe three other steps having the same rate, we can write:\n E V\nr  2 2 k RX AlCl C H Z [13.17]\n2 3 6 5\n1 n\n0\nAccording to [13.16], this leads us to:\nk K V\nr  2 2 RXC H ZAlCl  [13.18]\n6 5 3\nn\n0\nThe rate is therefore of the first order with respect to each of the reactants and\nalso proportional to the concentration of the catalyst. This result is confirmed\nexperimentally.\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 331\n13.1.4. Redox catalysis\nMany redox reactions require the hypothesis that intermediate oxidation states\nare needed to meet kinetic laws, which is made possible by the presence of the\ncatalyst.\nHence the reduction reaction [13.R6] of ferric ion by tin (II), which is extremely\nslow without a catalyst, is strongly catalyzed by chloride ions that are assumed to\npermit the presence of oxidation state III for tin:\n2Fe3+ + Sn2+ = 2Fe2+ + Sn4+ [13.R6]\nWith a high iron (III) over tin (II) concentration ratio, the rate law is:\n3+\nd[Fe ]\n k[Fe 3+ ][Sn 2+ ] [13.19]\ndt\nIn this expression, the constant k depends on the chloride ion concentration.\nThe following mechanism was first proposed by Weiss. It occurs according to\nthe steps [13.R6a] and [13.R6b]:\nFe3+ + SnCl - → Fe2+ + SnCl [13.R6a]\n3 3\nFe3+ + SnCl → Fe2+ + SnCl + [13.R6b]\n3 3\nWith the pseudo-steady state mode, it is easy to show that the rate becomes:\nd[Fe3] 2k' k\" [Fe3][SnCl]\n1 1 3\n  [13.20]\ndt k\" [Fe2]k [Fe3]\n1 2\n13.1.5. Autocatalytic reactions\nAn autocatalytic reaction is so called if any of the products catalyze this reaction.\nThis includes, for example, the acid hydrolysis of esters catalyzed by protons:\n- +\nCH COOC H +2H O=CH COO +C H OH + H O [13.R7]\n3 2 5 2 3 2 5 3\nIn general, an autocatalytic reaction is characterized by a curve of extent (or\nconcentration of a product formed in a closed environment) versus time that shows\nthe so-called “S” shape, as shown in Figure 13.3.\n332 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nNOTE 13.3.– Such “S\"” kinetic curves are also commonly obtained without any\nautocatalytic effect being required to explain them. Hence, remember that a “S”\ncurve in is not necessarily due to autocatalysis.\nFigure 13.3. “S” shape of an autocatalytic curve\n13.1.6. Enzymatic catalysis\nEnzymes are substances found in living organisms that catalyze most\nbiochemical reactions. These catalysts have four important properties:\n– an enzyme is specific in its reaction, and may even be stereochemistry specific;\n– enzymes are water soluble substances;\n– enzymes are catalysts that have an optimum temperature of action. This is\nbecause enzymes are not stable with temperature and thus counteract the kinetic\neffect of temperature, thus the existence of an optimum temperature;\n– enzymatic reactions have a particularly low temperature coefficient in the order\nof tens kilojoules per mole – 10 times less than a conventional chemical reaction.\nThis allows these reactions to achieve significant rates at relatively low temperatures\nin vivo.\nThe catalytic power of an enzyme is called its activity. The enzyme activity is\nthe amount of enzyme that produces the transformation of 1 mol of reactant, which\nis called the substrate, per minute at 25C.\nThe specific activity of an enzyme is its activity per milligram of enzyme. There\nis also a molar specific activity, which is the amount of substrate transformed per\nunit time per mole of enzyme.\n13.1.6.1. Enzymatic catalysis in solution\nThe simplest calculation of enzymatic reaction was encompassed in a\nmechanism determined by Michaelis and Menten. It is especially well suited for\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 333\nenzymatic reactions involving a single substrate S (reactant) and a single enzyme E.\nThis mechanism accounts for the most common experimental results:\n– the reaction rate is proportional to the enzyme concentration;\n– the reaction rate is proportional to very high substrate concentrations but is no\nlonger dependent of this concentration if very low.\nThe mechanism is proposed in two stages:\n– During the first step a complex between the enzyme E and substrate S is\nformed:\nSEES [13.R8a]\n– This complex is broken down during the second step, giving the product P and\nregenerating the enzyme:\nES EP [13.R8b]\nWe solve this system in the pseudo-steady state mode, neglecting the reverse\nreaction of step [13.R8b] and remembering that the sum of the amounts of free and\nbound enzyme are constant:\nESEE [13.21]\n0\nFrom pseudo-steadiness, we deduce:\nk' E S\nES 1 0 [13.22]\nk' Sk\" k'\n1 1 2\nThe reaction rate becomes:\nk' k' E S k' E S\nvk' ES 1 2 0  2 0 [13.23]\n2\nk' Sk\" k' k' k\" /k' S\n1 1 2 2 1 1\n334 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe constant k' k\" /k' is often called the Michaelis constant and denoted\n2 1 1\nKm, which leads to:\nk' E S\n2 0\nv [13.24]\nK S\nm\nTwo constants are determined from the experiment: k’ and K . To determine\n2 m\nthem, we plot the inverse of the reaction rate versus the reciprocal of substrate\nconcentration (see expression [13.25]). If the model is acceptable, we obtain a\nstraight line. The slope and intercept are used to calculate the two constants,\nknowing the initial concentration of the enzyme.\nThis law reflects the experimental results cited above. Indeed, at low substrate\nconcentrations that are negligible in comparison to the Michaelis constant, the\nreaction rate is proportional to the substrate concentration. With high substrate\nconcentrations, however, the Michaelis constant is negligible and the rate is\nindependent of the substrate concentration and proportional to the initial\nconcentration of the enzyme.\nNOTE 13.4.– Relation [13.24] can also be written:\nE 1 K\n0 m\n  [13.25]\nv k' 2 k' 2 S\nThis expression is the direct application of the law of the slowness to the case of\ncatalytic steps and written as:\nI  1 \n0    [13.26]\nv v\ni  i \nwhere I is the sum of the concentrations of free and bound catalytic sites, or [E] in\n0 0\nour example.\n13.1.6.2. Catalysis by immobilized enzymes\nIn the previous section, we dealt with homogeneous enzymatic catalysis using\nenzyme solutions. Enzymes can be used in another way by immobilizing them on\nmembranes. Substrate and product species are adsorbed at the adsorption sites,\nwhich are formed by the bound enzyme molecules. The kinetic study is then\ncompletely identical to that of kinetics with heterogeneous catalysis and is\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 335\nanalogous to the treatment presented in section 13.2. The Michaelis constant is an\nadsorption constant.\n13.2. Heterogeneous catalysis reactions\nA heterogeneous catalysis reaction is a reaction between reactants leading to\nproducts generally belonging to the same phase (liquid or gas) that uses the surface\nof a solid phase as its mechanism. There are two possible cases where this happens:\n– chain reactions in a homogeneous phase for which the reactor walls play a role,\nusually by causing a breaking reaction of recombination in the active centers, which\nwe have already discussed in Chapter 12, section 12.4.5.6;\n– heterogeneous catalysis itself, in which the solid phase is the catalyst (and\nsometimes makes it more selective) chosen to accelerate the reaction.\nWe will now examine the mechanisms and kinetics of the catalytic action of a\nsolid onto a reaction between gases.\n13.2.1. Experimental laws in heterogeneous catalysis\nThe kinetic experimental laws of heterogeneous catalysis express the reaction\nrate as a function of three main parameters: the concentrations or partial pressure of\nreactants and products; temperature; and surface area of the catalyst.\n13.2.1.1. Concentrations (or partial pressures) of reactants and products\nThere are several types of laws ranging, from simple laws such as rate per unit\narea that admit a single order with respect to reactants, to negative orders compared\nto the reaction products, such as the following (for a reaction with two gas reactants,\nA and B, for example):\nkP P\nv  A B [13.27]\na 1K P\ni i\nor:\nkP P\nv  A B [13.28]\na 2\n1K P\ni i\nThe amounts shown in the denominator may involve all the gases involved in the\nreaction (reactants, products and inert gases may be present) or only some of them.\n336 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n13.2.1.2. The temperature\nThe reaction rate often seems to obey Arrhenius’ law, although this property is\nsometimes controversial. Sometimes the rate is not influenced by temperature.\n13.2.1.3. Surface area of the catalyst\nIn general, the absolute rates are proportional to the area of the catalyst. This is\nobviously true of the area including the pore walls and not the outer area of the\nsolid.\nThe concept of specific area (measured in m2 per gram of catalyst) is of the\nutmost importance.\nThis proportionality of the reaction rate with the specific area of the catalyst\noften disappears with time and part of the area appears to be inactive during the\nreaction.\n13.2.2. Structure of the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis\nIt is commonly accepted that a catalytic reaction involves two reaction zones in\nwhich five steps occur:\n– interdiffusion of reacting gases within the product gases toward the surface\narea of the catalyst;\n– adsorption of reactants on the surface area of the catalyst;\n– the catalytic act, which is the chemical reaction itself, also on the surface area\nof the catalyst;\n– desorption of gases produced from the surface area of the catalyst;\n– interdiffusion of gases produced from the surface area of the catalyst toward\nthe gas volume, far away from the solid.\nInterdiffusion phenomena are governed by Fick’s law but gas interdiffusion is\nnot activated – the interdiffusion coefficients (variation of 0 in [12.25]) vary as a\npower of temperature. We will now focus on the catalytic act and more generally on\nthe phenomena occurring at the catalyst’s surface area. Gas pressures that will take\npart in the specified expressions are the pressures in close proximity to the surface.\nThey become the partial pressures in the volume of the gas phase only in the case of\nvery fast interdiffusions.\nIn most cases, the steps of adsorption and desorption – when required – are\nconsidered to occur very quickly and the whole adsorption–desorption process is\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 337\nconsidered to be in equilibrium. The expressions deduced from the models use the\n[9.R14] or [9.R15] equilibrium depending on whether the gas molecule is\ndissociated or not during adsorption. The law of mass action applied to these\nequilibriums leads to two written forms: pressure or the square root of pressure of\nthe Langmuir isotherm.\n13.2.3. Kinetics of the catalytic act\nWe will now successively consider the reactions of decomposition or\nisomerization, which involve a single reactant and reactions involving two reactants.\nThe surface reaction is assumed to be elementary.\n13.2.3.1. Kinetic study of reactions with a single reactant\nThis reaction is schematically represented by:\nA(gas) = gas products [13.R9]\n13.2.3.1.1. Establishing the generic rate law\nWe assume that the chemical reaction occurs from the adsorbed reactant and that\nthe products are formed in the adsorbed state (see Figure 13.4), so that step [13.R10]\nis considered elementary:\nAs  B sB -s [13.R10]\n2 1 2\nA B B\n1 2\ns s s s\nFigure 13.4. Catalytic reaction with a single reactant\nThe elementarity of reaction [13.R10] allows the concentration of A absorbed\n(A-s2) to be written:\ndA-s \n 2 k A-s  [13.29]\n2\ndt\nwhere k is a rate coefficient that, as a consequence, follows Arrhenius’ law with an\nactivation energy E:\na\n338 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nk k 0 exp   E a   [13.30]\n RT \nThe concentration per surface unit of A absorbed is linked to the ratio of the\nsurface  covered by A over the area s of the adsorption site by the following\nA 0\nrelation:\n2\nA-s  A [13.31]\n2\ns\n0\nThe variation in the amount of A absorbed in the gas phase is related to its\nconcentration in the absorbed phase (the adsorption equilibrium being always\nachieved) by:\ndAS.dA-s  [13.32]\n2\nand its partial pressure (in the vicinity of the catalyst) is related to the amount of A\nby:\nRT\ndP  dA [13.33]\nA\nV\nBy combining [13.31], [13.32] and [13.33], we have:\ndP RTS\n A 2k  [13.34]\nA\ndt Vs\n0\nThe adsorption isotherm of A follows Langmuir law in the presence of gas i,\nwhich includes all gases present in the medium: A, the reaction products and inert\ngases:\nK P\nA A\n  [13.35]\nA\n \n21K P\n i i\n i \nBy incorporating this into [13.26], we obtain the rate equation:\ndP kRTS K P\nA A A\n  [13.36]\ndt Vs 1K P\n0 i i\ni\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 339\nWe can denote the temperature by using [13.30] and the van ’t Hoff isochors\n[9.13] for the adsorption constants, and obtain:\n E    ΔH \nK 0 P exp a A exp A \n dP A  k 0 RTS A A   RT     RT   [13.37]\ndt Vs   ΔH \n0 1K 0 Pexp i \ni  i i   RT  \nThis generic law is complicated by both the influence of partial pressures of\nvarious gases and the temperature.

Specific solutions for reactions involving a single reactant\n340 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n13.2.3.1.2. Obtaining specific forms of the generic law\nA number of simple laws can be obtained from [13.37] depending on the\nimportance of different KP terms compared to 1 and between each other. Table\ni i\n13.1 lists some of these particular solutions, indicating the influence of temperature\nfor each.\n13.2.3.2. Kinetic study of reactions with two reactants\nThese reactions will be of the form:\nA (gas) + B(gas) = gas products [13.R11]\nWith the special case of the reaction between two identical molecules of gas\nbeing:\n2A (gas) = gas products [13.R12]\nThe reaction occurring at the catalyst’s surface leads to two interesting\nhypotheses that need to be considered:\nLangmuir and Hinshelwood assume that the surface reaction occurs between\nadsorbed gases in the following form:\nA-s + B-s = absorbed products [13.R13]\nElsey and Rideal assume that the reaction occurs between a molecule and a gas\nmolecule adsorbed at the interface – a step in the following form:\nA-s + B(gas) = absorbed products [13.R14]\nWe will successively consider these two models.\n13.2.3.2.1. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model\nThis time the reaction rate of the elementary step [13.R13] allows us to write:\ndA-s\n k A-sB-s [13.38]\ndt\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 341\nAs previously, the concentrations of absorbed A and B are connected to\ncorresponding degrees of recovery, and applying the Langmuir isotherm, we get:\n K P\nA-s A  A A [13.39]\ns  \nA s 1K P\nA i i\n i \n K P\nB-s B  B B [13.40]\ns  \nB s 1K P\nB i i\n i \nSites A and B presumably being common, we have:\ns s s [13.41]\nA B 0\nWe can use [13.32], [13.33] and [13.34], hence we get the rate:\ndP kRTS K K P P\n A  A B A B [13.42]\ndt Vs 0 2   2\n1K P\n i i\n i \nThis expression also shows the complex influence of partial pressures from both\ngases and that temperature does not follow Arrhenius’ law. As before, simpler\nexpressions can be established with some approximations. The second column in\nTable 13.2 shows such solutions.\nWe notice that by increasing the pressure PA while keeping PB constant we\nshould see a succession in the first three cases. This is what is observed in the\nreaction between ammonia and deuterium (heavy hydrogen) on iron, as shown by\nthe rate variation curves in Figure 13.5 with the partial pressures of ammonia and\ndeuterium.\n342 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nConditions Langmuir–Hinshelwood Rideal–Elsey\nkRTS kRTS\n1K i P i Vs 2 K A K B P A P B Vs K A P A P B\n0 0\nkRTS K K P P kRTS K P P\nK P 1K P\nA B A B A A B\nA A i i 2 2\nVs\n0\n1K\nA\nP\nA\n Vs\n0\n1K\nA\nP\nA\nkRTS K P kRTS\nK\nA\nP\nA\n1K\ni\nP\ni Vs 2 K\nB\nP\nB\nVs\nP\nB\nB B 0\nK A P A K B P B kRTS K A K B P A P B Not applicable:\nK B P B 1 Vs 0 2 K A P A K B P B  2 B is not absorbed in this\nmodel\n1K\ni\nP\ni\nkRTS K K P P kRTS K P P\nK P 1K P\nA B A B A A B\nj j i i Vs 0 2 K i P i  2 Vs 0 K j P j\nTable 13.2.

Variation of the rate as a function of the pressure of the adsorbed gas\nin the Rideal–Elsey mechanism\nWe notice a different result from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. As\nshown in Figure 13.6, the rate shifts from first order to zero with respect to A.\nNOTE 13.5.– Only the Rideal–Elsey model leads to power units for the sums at\nthe denominators. This result is at the origin of this model.\n13.2.4. Example of the kinetics of catalysis on a porous support\nTo increase the reaction rates, we ideally increase the catalyst’s surface area. For\nthis we either use porous catalysts or catalysts deposited on a thin layer at the\nsurface of a porous support. In section 13.2.4.1 we will consider catalysis in porous\n344 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nmedia in the case of a first order reaction with respect to a reactant gas. This can be\neither a reaction with a single gas or a reaction with two gases of zero order with\nrespect to the second gas (such cases are not always listed in Table 13.2, but are\npossible in special cases). The model we develop comes from Thiele and Wheeler.\n13.2.4.1. Wheeler model in a porous medium\nS and Vp are the specific area (area per gram) and the pore volume per gram\nBET\nof solid catalyst, respectively. We will calculate the average radius and length of\npores that are assumed to be cylindrical (see Figure 13.7), each having an elliptical\nopening.\nHere, p the porosity of the solid, defined as the ratio of total pore volume over\nthe apparent volume of the solid V :\na\nmV\np p [13.46]\nV\na\nFigure 13.7. Diagram of a cylindrical pore\nWe assume that the ratio of the area of the pore openings, S , over the total\nO\nexternal area of the solid, S , is equal to the porosity:\ne\nS\np O [13.47]\nS\ne\nWith the area of the pore opening, if r is the average radius of the pores, we\nhave:\n2\nS n r 2 [13.48]\nO p\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 345\nThe term 2 comes from the fact that we assume the pore axis has an average\nangle of 45° against the surface (tortuosity coefficient), so:\npS\nn  e [13.49]\np 2\nr 2\nThe pore volume per particle is therefore:\nmV n r 2 L S e pL [13.50]\np p\n2\nand the pore area per particles is:\nmS 2n rL [13.51]\nBET p\nBy taking the ratio of expressions [13.50] and [13.51], we obtain a classic\nrelation:\n2V\nr  p [13.52]\nS\nBET\nTo determine the average length of a pore, we write:\nmV\nL p 2 [13.53]\nS p\ne\nand using relation [13.46], we have:\nV\nL a 2 [13.54]\nS\ne\nFor example, if we apply the relation to spherical particles such as:\n3\n4r\n2\nV  and S 4r\na e\n3\nwe obtain:\nr\nL 2 [13.55]\n3\n346 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n13.2.4.2. Thiele’s catalytic model\nWe take the hypothesis that the absolute rate of a reaction can be written as in\n[13.56], with k being the pseudo-rate coefficient per area unit, assumed to obey\nArrhenius’ law with activation energy E :\na\nv k[A] S [13.56]\na\nThis reaction occurs in the cylindrical pores defined above (in section 13.2.4.2).\nWe can establish the model for gas A by ignoring the surface at the bottom of the\ncylinder (hypothesis: rL), which gives:\nA 2  2A\nk[A] r D dx [13.57]\nt x 2\nWe are considering a pseudo-steady state mode so:\nd\n2A\n2kADr [13.58]\n2\ndx\nTo resolve differential equation [13.58], we adopt the following limits:\n– If x = 0, therefore [A] = [A] : concentration of the gas volume far away from\n∞\nthe solid.\n A\n– If x  L, therefore  0: this assumes that all the gas is consumed in\n\nx\n\nL\nthe pore, since the flow at the bottom of the pore is zero.\nThe solution is written:\n  x\ncosh  h1 \n  L\nAA [13.59]\n coshh\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 347\nBy introducing the measure h, called Thiele’s modulus and defined by:\n2k\nhL [13.60]\nDr\nusing [13.56], the absolute rate of the reaction is therefore written:\nL\nv 2kr[A] dx [13.61]\na\n0\nBut by using [13.58], this rate can also be written:\nL 2\n2 d [A]\nv Dr  dx [13.62]\na 2\ndx\n0\nThe integration leads to:\nL\n2d[A]\nv Dr [13.63]\na  \n dx \n0\nWe take into account that the flow is zero at the bottom of the pore, thus the rate\nthe gas is consumed in a pore becomes:\n2d[A]\nv a Dr   [13.64]\n dx \n0\nHence by using [13.59]:\n2\nDr A\nv   htanh(h) [13.65]\na\nL\nFor the group of pores of a grain, the absolute rate is written:\n2\nn Dr A\nv  p  htanh(h) [13.66]\na\nL\n348 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe obtain the solution to our problem in the pseudo-steady state mode with a\nconstant partial pressure of A in the gas volume and a constant flow of a gas\ncontaining A.\nTwo limiting cases are interesting, depending of the range of Thiele’s modulus\nvalue.\nIf h0.2, then we can admit that tanhhh and the rate becomes:\n2\n2n Dr A\nv  p  h2 2n r LkA kS A [13.67]\na L p  \nWe obtain a rate proportional to the concentration of A (first order) in the gas\nvolume. In this expression, only constant k varies with temperature and therefore\ntaking the logarithm of rate and expressing the temperature, we notice that\nArrhenius’ law is followed and the temperature coefficient is equal to the activation\nenergy (true or measured) of the reaction interface:\nE [13.68]\na\nNOTE 13.6.– We notice that expression [13.67] is obtained for a pseudo-steady\nstate mode with the interface reaction as the rate-determining step.\nIf, on the contrary, h2 we can admit that tanhh1 and the rate becomes:\n2\nv  n p Dr A  hn r 2 A 2D k [13.69]\na L p  r\nIn the resulting expression, only constant k varies significantly with temperature,\nsince the diffusion of gas in a pore varies little with temperature. Passing to the\nlogarithm of the rate and expressing the temperature, we notice that Arrhenius’ law\nis still followed but the temperature coefficient is half the activation energy of the\nreaction interface:\nE\na\n [13.70]\n2\nNote that the result obtained is a particular solution of the pseudo-steady state\nmode determined by both the reaction and diffusion steps. It is not the diffusion rate-\ndetermining mode since constant k would be infinite. As it occurs frequently, we\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 349\ncannot say that we have a diffusion mode: the mode is a mixture of diffusion and\nreaction.\nIf we plot the Arrhenius graph (see Figure 13.8) from the two relations [13.67]\nand [13.69], we obtain two straight lines corresponding to each of the two specific\nmodes.

In practical\nterms, this means that the experiments meet this condition. For this, three ways of\nproceeding can be used:\n– We can work in a closed medium and only look at the beginning of the\nreaction, as for example with a consumption of less than 5% of A, but then what\nwill happen to the time needed to establish pseudo-steady state mode before the\nreaction?\n– We can work in a closed medium for a longer period and extrapolate the\nexperiments to a time, zero, but then which extrapolation should we choose?\n– We can work in an open medium, fix a consumption rate of A – let us say 5% –\nand set the flow based on the difference between the inlet and outlet concentrations\nd[A]. The rate is therefore given by the gas flow and we can choose the average\nconcentration of A between the inlet and outlet values.\n13.2.5. Influence of the catalyst surface area: poisoning\nPoisoning of catalysts is due to the specific action of certain species – poisons –\naccidentally being present at trace levels in the gas phase. It is assumed that the\npoisoning is due to adsorption of the poison at the catalyst surface:\n– by a very strong adsorption that will greatly increase the denominators of\nrelations [13.28], [13.34] or [13.39]; or\n– by adsorption of large molecules that will cover several sites in the catalyst\nrendering it unusable by decreasing the sites’ surface density.\nCatalysis and Catalyzed Reactions 351\nThese adsorptions cause “aging” of the catalyst. A poison is characterized by its\ntoxicity coefficient, which is the strongly negative slope of the line of the rate ratio\nin the presence and absence of poison, depending on its concentration in the inlet\ngas.\n13.3. Gas–solid reactions leading to a gas\nHere we consider heterogeneous reactions of the type:\nA(gas) + S(solid) = gas products [13.R15]\nSuch as, for example, the reaction of fluoridation of uranium tetra fluoride:\nF (gas) + UF (solid)=UF (gas) [13.R16]\n2 4 6\nFrom the viewpoint of reaction zones, this type of system is similar in all\nrespects to that of heterogeneous catalysis, with the same phenomena of diffusion\nand interfacial reaction. The only difference is consumption of the solid. In most\ncases this consumption will result in a continuous variation of the interface area\nbetween gas and solid (except in the case of a solid form of non-porous thin plates).\nFor example, if we take the case of the porous solid in section 13.2.4, the\nreaction at the x-axis point will lead to a variation of the average pore radius that can\nbe related to the reaction rate by writing that the variation in volume is equal to the\nmolar volume of the solid via the reaction rate:\n2r.dx.dr 2rV v.dx.dt [13.76]\nm\nor:\ndr V v.dt [13.77]\nm\nThe integration of [13.77] quickly becomes complicated, particularly due to the\nvariation of the surface rate with time and the x-axis that converts the cylindrical\npore into a cone-shapes pore, for example. A simple case is where, working in an\nopen environment at a constant concentration of gas reactants and a state mode\ndetermined by the reaction interface, the rate per unit area v is constant, the pore\nremains cylindrical and the integration leads immediately to:\nr r (1V v.t) [13.78]\n0 m\nThis expression can then be introduced into equation [13.69].\n352 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n13.4. Conclusion on catalysis\nWe initially only addressed the kinetic aspect of catalysis, but catalytic science,\nespecially heterogeneous catalysis, deals with many other aspects related to the\nnature of catalysts, their production and texture in relation to their specificity for a\ngiven reaction and its evolution over time with the problems of aging acting on a\ndecreased activity. There are many phenomena that kinetics not only notices but can\nanticipate.\nWith heterogeneous reactions, we only discussed the case of reactions of\n[13.R15] type. The most common are those that produce a new solid phase. The\nstudy of these types of reaction will be the topic of Chapter 14.\n13.5. Langmiur and Hinshelwood\nIrving Langmuir was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in\nsurface chemistry. He contributed to atomic theory and the understanding of atomic\nstructure by defining the concepts of valence shells and isotopes.\nSir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood’s early studies of molecular kinetics led to the\npublication of Thermodynamics for Students of Chemistry and The Kinetics of\nChemical Change in 1926. He studied the explosive reaction of hydrogen and\noxygen and described the phenomenon of chain reactions. Hinshelwood was jointly\nawarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1956 for his research into the mechanisms\nof chemical reactions.\nSir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood Irving Langmuir\n1897-1967 1881-1957\nFigure 13.9. Hinshelwood won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1956\nand Langmuir won it in 1932\nChapter 14\nKinetics of Heterogeneous\nStoichiometric Reactions\nA heterogeneous stoichiometric reaction is a reaction in which a condensed\nsubstance (solid or liquid) or one of its constituents (in the case of solutions) is\nconsumed in stoichiometric proportions compared to the heterogeneous catalysis,\nwhich is also an heterogeneous reaction but not stoichiometric. We have already\ndiscussed the heterogeneous stoichiometric reactions which do not produce a\ncondensed phase in section 13.3.\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the case where the condensed substances are pure\nsolid and the reaction generates a new solid phase. We saw in section 6.2.2 the\ndifferent families of these reactions, which can be represented by the chemical\nequation:\nA ( ν G)ν B ( ν G') [14.R1]\nG B G'\nWith heterogeneous kinetics of the formation of a new condensed phase, it is\nusual to present experimental results in various equivalent forms. Thus we find data\non the fractional extent (for a solid reactant) versus time and data from rate\ndepending on the fractional extent, as a function of intensive variables such as the\npartial gas pressures and temperature, and as a function of the size of the grains\nforming solid reactants. We will now briefly outline the results usually obtained.\n354 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n14.1. Extent versus time and rate versus extent curves\nThe shapes of kinetic curves obtained for the different types of reactions\nconsidered here can be classified into two groups.\nWe saw in section 6.2.2.2 the first group in which the rate is unchanging (Figure\n14.1): continuously growing, continuously decreasing or constant. The\ncorresponding kinetic curves (see Figure 14.1a) therefore curve upwards,\ndownwards or are straight lines. We have given some examples of laws with this\nbehavior, such as the parabolic Wagner law, linear law, etc.\nIn the second group, the kinetic curves have a so-called “sigmoid” shape (see\nFigure 14.1b), also called “S-curves”. The reaction rate curve (see Figure 14.1d) has\nthen a maximum corresponding to the inflection point of the kinetic curve. With rate\ncurves presenting a maximum, more complex laws have been proposed, including\nthat by Mampel in 1940. We will see later (in section 14.4.2) that the mathematic\nforms of such laws are complex.\nFigure 14.1. Generic shapes of the kinetics curves (fractional extent versus time) and rate\ncurves (rate versus time) for heterogeneous stoichiometric reactions\nIt is virtually impossible to relate the two sets of kinetic curves to families of\nspecific reactions. For the same reaction, it is possible to move from one family of\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 355\ncurves to another by changing a variable, such as the size of grains of powder.\nMoreover, we must not overestimate the difference between the two families; a shift\nof the inflection point in one direction or another would shift sigmoid curves to any\nof the curves in Figure 14.1a, and this can be done by changing the values of certain\nvariables, such as partial pressures, temperature or the shape and size of grains in the\ncase of solid reactants in powder form.\n14.2. The global model with two processes\nIt is commonly accepted that a chemical reaction that leads to the creation of a\nnew phase involves two processes: nucleation and growth. These two processes are\nactually both identical chemically heterogeneous reactions, as their respective\noverall balance is the same as the overall reaction balance. Hence, for a reaction that\nfrom solid A gives solid B, the two processes have the same chemical equation\n[14.R1]. These processes take place in different areas, however, and therefore have\ndifferent mechanisms.\nIndeed, nucleation is the process that allows a small block of solid B to be\ncreated on the surface of solid A (or more rarely within the solid) so that the growth\nis that of the size of B and requires the presence A and B simultaneously.\nEach process operates as a single reaction with its own kinetic properties: rate,\nfractional extent, surface areas and elementary steps.\nIt is clear that these two processes are interdependent, however, since they can be\nconsidered as:\n– two successive reactions, since it is not conceivable to consider growth unless\nit has been preceded by nucleation;\n– two parallel reactions: nucleation reactions may occur at the same time as\ngrowth, but in another location, such as on the surface of solid as shown in Figure\n6.2.\nFigure 14.2. Simultaneous nucleation and growth of a phase at two points of a tablet\n356 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nRegarding reaction zones, nucleation is a single-area reaction: the surface of\nsolid A is not yet covered by B; whereas growth involves several areas, as discussed\nin section 14.4.1.\nAs mentioned before, the two processes are intertwined and both are involved in\nthe progress of the reaction. Based on the balanced equation [14.R1], we can write\nthat the rate relative to solid A is the sum of a contribution of nucleation and growth:\nd d d\n    [14.1]\ndt  dt   dt \nnucl growth\nFortunately, in the vast majority of cases, nucleation involves only a small\namount of starting material, so its contribution to the total rate can be neglected and\nequation [14.1] is replaced by:\nd d\n  [14.2]\ndt  dt \ngrowth\nWarning: this approximation does not mean that all nucleation process effects\nare neglected. It is clear, for example, in Figure 14.2 that the growth rate at a given\ntime will depend on the number of growing phases that have been created during the\nprevious period.\n14.3. The E law\nSince the growth reaction occurs in several areas, it is not generally possible to\ndefine an areal rate. As mentioned in section 14.1.2, however, we will keep to the\nfrequent cases in which we can use the E law:\nr .E [14.3]\nThe growth space function is often complex because it incorporates the process\nof nucleation.\nWe assume that every heterogeneous reaction studied here, unless explicitly\nmentioned, meets conditions set by the E law and the pseudo-steady state mode.\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 357\nWhen these properties are met, we can distinguish the following:\n– The study of  properties, which is the rate per unit area and depends on the\nintensive parameters as any rate does.\n– The study of properties of E, which depends on the morphology and, as we\nshall see, is often the only measure that varies with time in isothermal and isobaric\nconditions. Hence the reaction rate variations with time are in fact variations of the\nspace function.\nWith two physico-chemical processes, it is necessary to model the two reaction\nmechanisms. Hence, the basic steps of nucleation and growth have to be written.\nWe will initially discuss the modeling of the growth space function that is also\ncalled morphological modeling or geometric modeling.\n14.4. Morphological modeling of the growing space function\nMorphological modeling is based on the existence of the concept of grains. A\ngrain of reactant A is defined as the smallest portion of A that is completely\nsurrounded by other phases. Thus we can measure the total grain surface by\nmeasuring the surface area using the BET (Brunnauer, Emmet and Teller) method.\nThis grain is assumed to be non-porous, which can be verified experimentally.\nIf sample A is present in the single bulk form, it is said to be made of a single\ngrain only.\nNOTE 14.1.– This definition of the grain is different from the one encountered in\nmetallurgy, for which grain is an oriented area in a phase explaining that bulk metals\nusually contain several grains.\n14.4.1. The hypothesis\nMorphological modeling is based on a number of assumptions, some of which\nare verifiable experimentally:\n– Nucleation of the final solid occurs at the surface of the initial solid whenever\nthe reaction requires an exchange between sample A and another phase. This means\nthat among the typical reactions, only polymorphic transformations (e.g.\ntransformation of titanium dioxide from anatase form into rutile form) do not meet\nthis criterion and therefore will be the only type of transformation for which the\nnucleation in bulk A will be considered (this is not mandatory). In all other cases, we\n358 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nassume that every spot is formed on the surface of grains of A, which can be verified\nby microscopic examination.\n– The surface is homogeneous with regards to the nucleation, which is to say that\nthe probability of seeing a spot is the same at any point located on this surface.\n– The nucleation rate (number of spots that have emerged between t and t dt) is:\n.S [14.4]\nL\nIn this relation, S is the surface area of A not yet covered by the solid B\nL\n(dimension of the nucleation area).\n– The elementary steps of the growth reaction are located in one of the following\nthree areas (see Figure 14.3):\n- chemical reactions or adsorptions occurring at the external interface between\nthe initial solid A and the external phase;\n- chemical reactions taking place at the internal interface between the solid A\nand the solid B formed; or\n- diffusions through the solid B formed.\n– Internal and external interfaces are homogeneous, which is to say that the\nreactions that take place do not depend on the point of these interfaces.\n– The rate coefficients of one of the elementary steps of the growth reaction are\nmuch lower than the other steps (approximation of a pseudo-steady state mode with\na single rate-determining step).\nFigure 14.3.

Reactivities and space functions at the different\nreaction areas of a grain\nWe show that the last hypothesis allows us to use relation [14.3] for a growing\nspot:\n– If the rate-determining step is a reaction at the interface, is its specific rate\n(rate per surface area units) and E is the area of this interface (Sp) where it is taking\nplace, per unit of initial amount of solid A:\nS\np\nE [14.5]\nn\n0\n– If the rate-determining step is the diffusion of species through layer B, the\nspatial function will depend on the shape of the diffusion. If S is the area of the\ni\ninternal interface, the spatial function is given by equation [14.6], where G is the\ngeometric factor given by the second column in Table 14.1:\nSG\nE i [14.6]\nn\n0\n360 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nHence, Table 14.1 summarizes the reactivity and spatial functions of the steps\ninvolved in the various areas of Figure 14.3, where n is the initial amount of\n0\nmaterial in a grain of A.\n14.4.2. Types of model involving one or two processes\nThese models must include the presence of the two processes of nucleation and\ngrowth. At the beginning, researchers tried to simplify the problem by analyzing\nborderline cases in which one of the two processes was taking place very quickly\nwith the respect of the other. These are called borderline cases or single process\nmodels since either the single growth or nucleation process evolution over time is\ntaken into account, while the other is considered to have an infinite speed.\nModels in which both processes occur simultaneously have been developed.\nThere are two process models.\n14.4.2.1. Single-process models\n14.4.2.1.1. Laws issued from the single-process model\nWith these models, either the nucleation or growth processes occur very rapidly\ncompared to the other. There are two families:\n– single-process models with instantaneous nucleation; and\n– single-process models with instantaneous growth.\nFigure 14.4. Appearance of grains of a powder in: a) instantaneous nucleation;\nand b) instantaneous growth\nWith instantaneous nucleation models, it is assumed that the entire surface of\nevery grain of A is covered by B from the initial instant, which is then followed by\nthe growth of a layer of B. Looking at the state of the powder during the reaction, we\nwill discover that every grain is in the same state, with a nucleus of A covered by a\nlayer of B (see Figure 14.4a). This layer has the same thickness on every grain,\nwhatever its shape and size.\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 361\nWith instantaneous growth models, each time a growth spot is created over a\ngrain of A, it is immediately transformed into B. If we look at the state of the powder\nduring the reaction, we have intact grains of A and B that are fully completed (see\nFigure 14.4b).\n14.4.2.1.2. Principle of the development of instantaneous nucleation models\nWe will now develop an example of a process that allows instantaneous\nnucleation in order to approach an easy method that can be extended to other\nmodels. In the case of instantaneous nucleation, every grain displays the same\nbehavior over time. It is therefore enough to develop a model for a single grain and\napply relation [14.3].\nTo express the spatial function, we must choose the step that determines the\ngrowth. Suppose that this step is diffusion through the solid that is formed: the\nfunction space E will be given by Table 14.1. We must therefore choose the form of\nthe grains and consider same size of plates (last row in Table 14.1). The kinetic law\nis written with e\n0\nbeing the initial thickness of the plate and S\n0\nbeing its initial\nsurface, neglecting the fields:\nd S\nr  . 0 [14.7]\ndt n e\n0\nIf we consider a semi-plate A (see Figure 14.5), the initial thickness is e /2 and\n0\nS e\nthe initial quantity of material is n  0 0 , if V is the molar volume. The\n0 mA\n2V\nmA\ninternal interface keeps a constant surface area S .\n0\nAt a time t the thickness is e, which corresponds to a fractional extent  for the\nreaction:\n2e\n [14.8]\ne\n0\n362 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nHence, we get the law:\nd 4 V\nm A\n [14.9]\ndt e 2 \n0\nand by integration:\n 2 \n8 V\nMAt [14.10]\n2\ne\n0\nThis law is known as Wagner’s parabolic law.\nFigure 14.5. Attack of a semi plate\nIf the sample is now a powder consisting of the same grains, we can show that\nwith instantaneous nucleation every grain simultaneously has the same behavior and\nso the law deduced for a single grain can be applied to the whole powder.\n14.4.2.1.3. Shapes of curves derived from single-process laws\nEvery law derived from these models involves a process leading to expressions\ncontaining only one parameter. This parameter is the reactivity  of the slow\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 363\nprocess, even if for nucleation the use of the frequency of surface nucleation  is\npreferred, as discussed in section 14.5.5. Graphs of these laws have one of three\nforms shown in Figure 14.1.a, including constant rates (Figure 14.1.c).\n14.4.2.1.4. Data required to define a single-process model\nThe construction of models has shown that the following data are required to\nestablish the rate law in a single-process model:\n– The shape of the grain that defines the shape of the reaction area is required to\ncalculate the space function.\n– The direction of growth development. Layer B may develop either into A (see\nFigure 14.6.a, internal development) or outward (see Figure 14.7.b, external\ndevelopment). The active surface area will depend on the direction of development.\nTo establish the direction of development a marker is used, such as a thin deposit of\ngold or wire, placed on a portion of the surface of reactant A before the reaction.\nDuring the reaction, the microscopic examination of a section allows us to identify\nthe marker position located at interface A/B in the case of an external development,\nor at the external surface of B in the case of internal development (see Figure\n14.6.b). We can also cut a grain of A after a sufficient reaction time if a cavity is\nfound within A: this is evidence of external development.\nFigure 14.6. Development of the new phase: a) internal; and b) external\nNOTE 14.2.– Decomposition reactions, such as [14.R2] and polymorphic\ntransformations that involve only a single reactant, always take place with internal\ndevelopment of the new solid phase. Reactions involving two reactants can lead to\ninternal or external development.\nTable 14.2, part of which is due to Sharp, summarizes some of the laws\ninvolving a single process in the assumption of internal development for powders\n364 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nmade of similar grains. The practice has led each act to be named according to the\nnomenclature given in the last column. This table is supplemented with models of\nthe determining steps at the external interface.

Morphological laws involving one process for powders with external\ndevelopment and different grain shapes\n14.4.2.2. Double-process models\nWith double-process models, the evolution of both processes over time is taken\ninto account. At time t, while an existing spot is trying to grow, another spot may be\ncreated on an open area of the surface of A of the same or another grain.\n14.4.2.2.1. Two types of growth\nWith double-process models, two types of growth have been considered and thus\ntwo families of models with two processes have been developed, each corresponding\nto a mode of growth:\n– Anisotropic growth models: when a spot is formed on a grain, the grain is\nimmediately covered by B. The tangential growth rate of the new phase is a lot faster\nthan the radial growth rate. If we represent the grains of powder during the reaction,\nwe can simultaneously encounter free and attacked grains of A at a different level of\n366 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\ngrowth progression, as well as grains completely transformed into B, provided the\ngrowth reaction time is long enough (see Figure 14.7.a).\n– Isotropic growth models: for which the growth is the same in all three\ndimensions so grains of B are portions of spheres on the surface A (Figure 14.7b)\ncreated from seeds at different times.\na)\nb)\nFigure 14.7. Schematic diagram of a grain: a) isotropic growth;\nand b) anisotropic growth\n14.4.2.2.2. Laws derived from models with two processes\nTo determine laws derived from these models within the scale of the growing\nspot, we still use relationship [14.3] expressing E from Table 14.2. The difficulty is\ngreater, however, because we must estimate the total area of internal interfaces on\nthe set of nucleus being grown on all grains as shown in Figures 14.7a and 14.7b. It\nis in the calculation of these areas that the second parameter of nucleation appears\nand therefore the laws obtained are for two parameters whose values are determined\nby temperature and the partial pressures of gases.\nConsider a growing spot created at time t. At an instant t subsequent to its\ngrowth rate will be: r (,t). Between instants  and   d, however, new growth\ng\nspots are born: ()d, if () is the frequency of nucleation (number of spots\nproduced per time unit). The reaction rate due to the growth at instant t will be:\nr (,t)  ()r (,t) [14.11]\ng\nNew growth spots can be created at any time between 0 and t, thus in order to\nexpress the reactance of the reaction, it is necessary to integrate the previous\nexpression:\nt\n1\nr(t)  () r (,t).d [14.12]\ng\nn\n0 0\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 367\nIn this expression, rg(, t) is the contribution of a spot created at time  to the\ngrowth rate.\nWe will see later (section 14.6) that if  and S () respectively represent the\nL\nfrequency of the surface nucleation (independent of time in a pseudo-steady state\nmode) and the spatial function of nucleation (which is the area of the free surface of\nsolid A), the frequency of nucleation is always:\n()  S () [14.13]\nL\nExpression [14.12] becomes:\nt\n1\nr(t)  S () r (,t) d [14.14]\nL g\nn\n0 0\nMoreover, if growth is given by [14.3] and e is the growth space function of the\np\nspot, t the time function, the age of the spot, and  its reactivity that will only be a\nfunction of the intensive physico-chemical parameters if the system evolves at\nconstant temperature and partial pressures; the growth rate is:\nr (,t)  (t) e (,t) [14.15]\ng p\ne is given in the last column of Table 14.1, according to the location of the rate-\np\ndetermining step and the development orientation of the new solid phase. Therefore:\nt\n\nr(t)  S () e (,t)   E [14.16]\nL p\nn\n0 0\nGrowth has a separable rate, which is also the case of the global reaction so in\nthe generic case the space function is:\nt\n1\nE  S () e (,t) d [14.17]\nL p\nn\n0 0\nThis measure corresponds to the total active area calculated for the all the grains\nof the powder.\n368 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe previous development assumes that each powder grain takes part in the\nreaction, which is true as long as the powder does not contain completely\ntransformed grains. Indeed, grains that are fully transformed at time t are no longer\navailable to take part in the reaction. A grain that has nucleated at the initial time\nwill be fully transformed at time t, required for the grain transformation. At a time t\nf\nlarger than t, every grain that has nucleated before time t – t is fully transformed.\nf f\nHence the previous relations must be divided into two relations:\n– if t < tf, we can apply [14.16]; and\n– if t > tf, we will replace it with:\nt\n\nr(t)   S () e (,t) d [14.18]\nL p\nn\n0tt\nf\nIf the physico-chemical variables (temperature and partial pressures of gases) are\nkept constant throughout the reaction, the frequency of nucleation  no longer\ndepends on time and the term can be removed from the sum sign.\nIn the general case of nucleation growth, the rate function [14.16] or [14.18]\ndoes not give a general shape to the curves giving fractional extent versus time. We\nmust deal with individual cases to examine the shape of these curves.\nIn most cases, these laws lead to kinetic curves with an inflection point (S-\ncurves), as shown in Figure 14.2.b. The corresponding rate curve (Figure 14.2.d)\nwill be at a maximum.\nThe establishment of two-process models requires the same data as for single-\nprocess models (grain shape and orientation of the layer development) by adding the\nchosen mode of growth (isotropic or anisotropic). Note that in models involving an\ninstantaneous nucleation process, the growth is anisotropic by default.\n14.4.2.3. Example of a law including two processes\nWe consider the case of a powder made of wafers with the same surface area S .\n0\nWe assume that the growth is anisotropic and determined by a reaction occurring at\nthe internal interface with a constant area S (neglecting the fields of the wafer). To\n0\napply relations [14.16] and [14.18], we must determine functions S ()and e (t,)\nL p\nas well as the limit time t.\nf\nTable 14.1 immediately gives us the growth space function in the case of a\nwafer. This function does not depend on the time or the age of the growing spot:\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 369\nS\ne  0 [14.19]\np\nn\n0\nThe growth rate of a grain that has nucleated is:\nS V S V\nr e  0  mA 0  mA [14.20]\ng p\nn e S e\n0 0 0 0\nFor a growing spot born at time , the kinetic law will therefore be:\nV\n mAt [14.21]\ne\n0\nThe time taken to consume a grain is the time taken for the fractional extent to\nreach one unit:\ne\nt  0 [14.22]\nf\nV\nmA\nTo calculate the area S still available for nucleation at time , we denote by N\nL\nthe number of grains not yet attacked at the time . Since every grain attacked at is\ncoated with a layer of solid B, the free surface of nucleation will be given by the\nproduct of the area of a grain at the initial time by the number N free grains.\nS  N S [14.23]\nL 0\nBetween times  and  + d, however, the decrease in the number of free grains\nis given by the nucleation frequency:\ndN   N S d [14.24]\n0\nBy integration between times 0 and  for which the number of free grains are N\n0\nand N, respectively, we have:\nN  N exp( S ) [14.25]\n0 0\nThe available nucleation area is therefore:\nS  N s exp( S ) [14.26]\nL 0 0 0\n370 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe initial number of grains, N , is related to the initial amount of reactant A, per\n0\ngrain n by the relation:\n0\nA\nN  0 [14.27]\n0 n\n0\nhence the area of the free surface of nucleation is:\nA S\nS  0 0exp(  S ) [14.28]\nL n 0\n0\nTaking into account [14.20], we express [14.19] and [14.28] in [14.17] and:\ne\n– If t 0 :\nV\nmA\nA V 2 t\nr(t)  0 mA expS \n2 0\n2e\n0 0\n[14.29]\nA V 2\n 0 mA 1expS t\n2  0 \n2e S\n0 0\ne\n– If t  0 :\nV\nmA\nr(t)  A 0 V m 2 A   exp   S 0 e 0   expS t   [14.30]\n2   0\n2e 0 S 0    V mA   \nFunctions [14.29] and [14.30] lead to a curve with a maximum whose position\ndepends on the initial area, the plate thickness and the ratio of /.\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 371\nUnlike the case we have just discussed, in most cases the integrals cannot be\ncalculated algebraically and we must be content with rate laws defined by the\nintegrals that are calculated numerically.\nIn conclusion, we see that many laws are available to account for the function\nspace, which is the rate variation over time in isothermal and isobaric conditions.\nWhile it is still difficult to attribute a model to a particular family of reactions, we\nnotice that all the oxidation reactions of a metal (such as [14.R4]) are modeled by\nsingle process, which is perfectly logical because it is extremely difficult to carry out\nexperiments in areas that are completely free of metal oxide traces. We also notice\nthat the reactions between solids, such as [14.R5], are also frequently modeled in a\nsingle process, since in this case there is fast diffusion on the surface of the grains\nthat are in contact with each other. On the other hand, most decomposition reactions,\nsuch as [14.R2], are modeled with two processes; although in some cases the\nmaximum rate of curve 14.2c is quite near to the origin.\n14.4.2.4. Influence of sample history on rate\nFrom equations [14.16] and [14.18], we notice that the rate at a given time is not\nfixed by values of physico-chemical variables, time and extent at this time. As a\nresult of the process of nucleation, the rate depends on the history of the sample,\nparticularly the partial pressures and temperatures that prevailed at the beginning of\nthe reaction that set the surface frequency of nucleation. The reaction extent is no\nlonger a variable of the rate. This phenomenon does not occur in models with one\nprocess, for which the fractional extent is enough to fix the rate at given conditions\nof pressure and temperature, whatever the previous values of these variables.\nTo illustrate this we will consider the case of a pseudo-steady state mode of\ngrowth that is defined, for example, by an elementary step taking place at the\ninternal interface and that develops internally.\n(S) (\ni A S)\ni B\nB A\nA B\nA B (a) (b)\nFigure 14.8. Influence of the sample history on rate for a given state of progress: a) under\nfixed conditions; and b) under other conditions where the grain’s\nnucleation and growth rate have different values\n372 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nFigure 14.8a illustrates the configuration of a grain obtained under fixed\nconditions (in order to visualize the surface areas, plane interphase surfaces are\nrepresented). The grain is characterized by certain areas of the interphase surface\n(Si)A coming from the growth of two growing spots of B.\nFigure 14.8b shows a diagram of a grain initially identical to the previous one at\nthe same fractional extent (same volume of the new phase formed), but obtained in\nother conditions for which the specificity of the grain’s nucleation and growth rate\nhad different values. In this figure, we can see only one growing spot of B instead of\ntwo.\nConsequently, the interfacial area (Si)B is half the size of the previous case. If\nthis grain was instantly placed in the same development conditions as the grain in\nFigure 14.8a, the growth reactivity and nucleation frequency of the grain in Figure\n14.8b would have had the same values as in a. The space function being half,\nhowever, the rate at which the product is formed will be halved compared to the\nFigure 14.8a. Thus, with nucleation growth it is not possible to characterize the rate\nin the conditions given by the fractional extent, temperature and partial pressures.\nThe rate depends on the history of the sample.\n14.4.3. Experimental research on the type of morphological model\nIt is experimentally useful to know whether the search for a morphological\nmodel should be directed towards single- or double-process models. We have seen\nthat in the case of a single-process model the rate at a given time depends on the\nvalues of variables at that moment, while in a nucleation growth with two processes\nthe previous evolutions of these variables affect the rate, i.e. the rate depends on the\nhistory of the system. It is this property that we will use to choose the family of\nmodels suitable for the reaction being studied.\nA first experiment is carried out under conditions T P to obtain the rate curve I\n(see Figure 14.9). A second experiment was started under conditions T', P with a\ndifferent temperature from the initial one and gives curve II. The switch method is\nthen applied at a certain stage to restore T and P conditions. Two cases may occur:\n– after the switch, the rate curve joins the curve obtained with the same initial T\nand P conditions; hence a single-process model will be enough since the speed of\nconditions (T, P) does not depend on previous conditions; or\n– after the switch, the rate curve deviates from curve I; a double-process model\nwill be necessary here because the rate conditions (T, P) depend on the previous\nconditions.\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 373\nd (II) Double-processes model\nT, P\ndt\nT, P\nT’, P\n(I)\nSingle-process T, P\nmodel\n \n\n\n\n1\nFigure 14.9. Test principle for selecting the family of morphological patterns\n14.5. The nucleation process\n14.5.1. Description of the nucleation process\nNucleation occurs by agglomeration of point defects on the surface of solid A.\nThis nucleation will require two stages: the creation of point defects and their\nagglomeration.\nFor example, during the dehydration of a salt to give a solid anhydrous salt, such\nas:\nA,H O  AH O [14.R2]\n2 2\nboth processes would lead to the following in the growing spot:\n– Formation of water molecule vacancies in the initial hydrate as loss of water in\nits gaseous state results in non-stoichiometric hydrate, considered a solution of\nvacancies in the solid and having the structure of the hydrate. This process can be\nrepresented by the quasi-chemical equation:\nH O =V +H O(gas) [14.R2a]\n2 H O H O 2\n2 2\n– Precipitation of the second phase by the disappearance of n vacancies:\nnV  0 [14.R2b]\nH O\n2\n374 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIn this quasi-chemical relation, the zero value of the second member represents\nthe presumably perfect new phase.\nWith the example of a gas–solid reaction, like the formation of an oxide by\nreaction of gaseous oxygen with a metal, the first stage would be the dissolution of\noxygen in the metal:\nO  2O [14.R3a]\n2 dissolved\nThe second step is the oxide formation:\nO + M = MO [14.R3b]\ndissolved M\nWe see from these examples that the nucleation can always be split into two\ngroups of steps:\n– the defect formation in the initial solid, which will be the precursor of the\nnucleation; and\n– the precursor condensation on the surface of the initial solid.\n14.5.2. Thermodynamics of nucleation\nHere we consider the nucleation model and assume that precursors and their\nassociations are dissolved in solid A up to a certain level of aggregation that will be\nthe basis of the growing spot, which we assume to be a pure solid in its phase. These\naggregates are so small and contain so few atoms, however, that we must take the\nsurface factor into account in the Gibbs free energy function as the product of the\nvariation of the area by its associated measure, which is the surface tension  .\ni\nWhere S is the oversaturation of defects in A, we obtain the following ratio for\nglobal reactions such as [14.R1]:\nP\nG\nP\nG\nG G\nS  G  G [14.31]\nK G\nexp \n RT \nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 375\nNOTE 14.4.– The definition of S allows us to link oversaturation to the distance\nfrom equilibrium :\n1\n1  [14.32]\nS\nWhere  (G) is the condensation free enthalpy linked to the formation\nX,i\nreaction of one mole of aggregate each containing i building units of A, this is the\nfree enthalpy change associated with reaction:\niX  X [14.R4]\ni\nWe can write:\n (G)   (G)   . () [14.33]\nX,i X,i chem s X,i\nFrom [14.29], if N is Avogadro’s number, we have:\na\nRT\n (G) i ln(S) [14.34]\nX,i chem\nN\na\nIf the growing spot was a sphere, its surface would be 4r2 and its\n3\nvolume4r /3.

Nucleation of a drop at the surface\n376 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIf the spot was a drop shaped as a spherical cap as shown in Figure 14.10, the\nmeniscus would show an angle  with the plane, and the radius would be:\n1/3\n 3V i \nr  m f het [14.36]\n\n4N\na \nwhere f is a measure related to the cosines of the angle  by:\nhet\n(2+cosq)(1-cosq)2 (2+p)(1-p)2\nf = = [14.37]\nhet\n4 4\nand p is the spreading parameter between –1 and +1.\nIn the case of a solid spot, we can still define a spreading coefficient fhet linked\nto a spreading parameter p as a function of interfacial tension, always between -1\nand +1.\nThe area of the spot will be:\n2/3\n 3V i \n4 m f het [14.38]\n\n4N\na \nIncorporating [14.32] and [14.33] in [14.31], for the free enthalpy per mole we\nhave:\n1/3\n 2  2/3\n (G)iRTln(S) 36 V N f i\nX,i s m a het\n[14.39]\n2/3\naibi\nBy canceling the derivation, we see that function  (G) f(i) admits a\nA,i\nmaximum value at the coordinates:\n  n  32N a  3 s V m 2 [14.40]\n 3 RTlnS3\n\n\n 3 2 n\n16N  V\n (G)  a s m  RT ln(S) [14.41]\n A,n 3 RT ln(S)2 2\n\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 377\nCurve I in Figure 14.11, which gives the representation of [14.38], is called the\nVolmer curve.\nAccording to [14.41], the maximum ordinate is even smaller when the\nequilibrium conditions (excluding superficial phenomena) are exceeded (when S or \nare large), and this ordinate is cancelled at conditions far from equilibrium (S\ninfinite), i.e. never.\nFigure 14.11. Nucleation free enthalpy as a function of the size of the growing spot\nAs well as the maximum H, point M is also noticeable on this curve and\n*\ncorresponds to an aggregate of size n so that the free enthalpy associated with the\ncondensation reaction of one mole of aggregate is zero and becomes negative:\n\n3V2\ni  n*  36N s m [14.42]\na 3\nRT ln(S)\nBefore M, the associated free enthalpy is positive; whereas it is negative for\nlarge sizes.\nWhen the size of the spot grows, curve I tends toward curve II, which represents\nfunction [14.46] when the surface parameters are neglected.\nThe size of the spot will be the size at which we switch from the nucleation\nprocess, which considers surface parameters, to the growth process that neglects\nthem (following curve II in Figure 14.11) but considers both interfaces.\nCurve I shows that a new growth spot cannot be formed before point M as the\nfree enthalpy value is positive.\n378 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nIt is accepted that the nucleation process ends at point M and that the size of the\ngrowth spot is n*. We will see that we are not allowed to choose point H in the\nmechanism, since positive free enthalpy has to be chemically driven by other\nnegative free enthalpies so that the overall reaction free enthalpy is negative. Point\nM is the first point at which these conditions are required.\n14.5.3. The nucleation mechanism\nIn section 14.6.1, we saw that the nucleation process involves two stages, each of\nthem including elementary steps occurring on the whole surface of the solid A. The\nrespective rate will therefore have the same space function. We will examine the\ntype of elementary steps that could describe these two stages.\n14.5.3.1. Formation of one or several precursors\nThe formation of precursors, which are point defects, will take place during\nvarious elementary steps occurring at the interface between the initial solid and a\nsurrounding phase. If gases are involved, chemisorption or desorption processes are\nalso occurring at the surface of the solid.\nThe formation of an anhydrous salt from its hydrated form will pass via the\nformation of water vacancies, for example, according to the following process:\nH O =V +H O [14.R5]\n2 H O H O 2\n2 2\nThis reaction can be split into two steps equivalent to elementary steps:\n– the vacancy formation with the chemisorbed water at the gas–solid interface\narea:\ns+H O V +s-H O [14.R5a]\n2 H O H O 2\n2 2\n– desorption of water at the solid surface:\nsH Os+H O [14.R5b]\n2 2\nWe see that the two areas where the two steps take place will always be the same\nsize during the system evolution, even if these areas vary over time. This is valid for\nany precursor formation at the surface.\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 379\n14.5.3.2. Precursor condensation\nCondensation is the increase of the aggregates’ dimensions by the addition of\nprecursors. This reaction occurs on the homogeneous phase of the solid and is\ncomparable to a polymerization reaction.\nThe condensation of precursors (defects previously created) will happen in the\nregion where they are present at their highest amount, which is at the area of\nformation. With defects created at the surface, condensation will occur inside the\ninitial solid close to the interface. Thus, condensation only occurs in one area and in\nthe case where the dimensions remain the same as those involved in the precursor\nformation. The nucleation process occurs in several areas, but the dimensions of\nthese areas always remain equal to each other over the time during which the system\nevolves. Everything that occurs is the same as if a single area was involved.\nIt is accepted that condensation is a succession of elementary steps, each of them\nadding a building unit to the aggregate that follows the addition of a precursor.\nThere are two types of condensation:\n– simple condensation with precursors; and\n– condensation of precursors at specific points located within the solid (or at the\nsurface), which are called potential growth spots. These potential spots are limited in\nnumber. They are progressively consumed by the nucleation and no new ones are\ngenerated. The solid is closed in relation to these potential spots, whereas it is often open\nin relation to other precursors. These potential sites can often be of a different nature:\nthey can be specific energy points of the solid, dislocations, grain boundaries or\nforeign species (impurities) dissolved in the solid.\n14.5.3.2.1. Simple condensation\nWe consider the following reaction:\nA... B [14.R6a]\nB\nPrecursor X is in a sequence of steps from [14.R6b] to [14.R6n*]. Entities of the\nprecursor will attach to each other (excluding reactions between two aggregates of\ndimensions greater than one).\nTo highlight the fact that the last step results in a new phase, we add the term B\n(unit activity). The mechanism is represented by the following:\nX X  X [14.R6b]\n2\n380 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nX X  X [14.R6c]\n2 3\n…\nX X  X [14.R6i]\ni1 i\n…\n*\nX\nn*1\nX n B [14.R61n*]\n14.5.3.2.2. Condensation of potential growth spots\nEntity X is the potential growth spot that is used as the groundwork to attach the\n1\nsecond entity, which is the precursor X (step [14.R6a]). Molecules of precursor X\nsuccessively attach to each other to increase the dimensions of the growing spot (steps\n[14.R6b] to [14.R6n*]) until the production of B, when the spot enters the growth\nstage after reaching size n*.\nPrecursor X is formed from the production stage as with simple condensation;\nhence the solid is closed in relation to X and open in relation to X:\n1\nX X  X [14.R6a]\n0 1\nX X  X [14.R6b]\n1 2\n…\nX X  X [14.R6i]\ni1 i\n…\n*\nX X n B\nn*1\n14.5.4. The nucleation rate\nOnly the mechanism of simple condensation will be presented here. This will\nintroduce a method that is also applicable to the potential mechanism of spot growth.\nFirst, looking at steps of the mechanism we see that in order to obtain the overall\nreaction and form  moles of B, all the steps must be multiplied by the common\nB\nmultiplying coefficient:\n\n \nB\n[14.43]\nn*\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 381\nThe nucleation reaction [14.R1] has the same global equation as the\ntransformation reaction. We define the rate of nucleation as the rate in relation to the\nnewly-formed solid B.\nThe rate coefficients of step i: k' and k\" are such that their ratio is the\ni i\nequilibrium constant of step i and we can write:\nK  k' i exp(  i1,i\n(G0)\n)\ni\nk\" RT\ni [14.44]\n\n(G0) (G0)\nX,i X,i1\nexp( )\nRT\nThe overall equilibrium constant of the condensation is given by:\nn*  B/n*\n \nK   K [14.45]\ni\ni2\nThe reactivity of step i is:\n  k' x.x  k\" x [14.46]\ni i i1 i i\nBy applying relations [14.3] and [14.42], the superficial rate of condensation will\nbe:\n  n*\n \nn*\n\nn*\n[14.47]\nnucl\n \nB\nTo reach this rate, we must calculate the reactivity of the last step. Using [14.44],\nwe can write the reactivity of the current step:\n  k\" (K x.x  x ) [14.48]\ni i i i1 i\nor if expressing the Gibbs free energy:\n i  n* k\" i  exp     X,i (G)     1  1  [14.49]\n B     RT      S\n382 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe will assume that the activation energy of the reverse of a reaction step does not\ndepend on of the rank of this step, but it is in fact the bond breakage between a\npromoter and agglomerate, which is more likely with increasing i. If a is the length\nof the order of magnitude of the network of initial solid A, the surface rate\ncoefficient of the reverse reaction can be written:\nkTa E kTa E\nk\"  exp  i  exp  [14.50]\ni\nh RT h RT\nIf we consider a pseudo-steady state mode and we chose a step resulting in the\nmaximum of the Volmer curve as the determining step, the surface rate of the last\nstep is:\n \nn* [n*]\n n*a RT .exp   E      exp   16..f het .N a . s .V m 2       1 1 \n B N a h   RT      3RT3   InS  2      S\n[14.51]\nIncorporating [14.51] into [14.47], the rate of nucleation can be expressed\nknowing that nucleation occurs on the free surface of solid A of area S at moment t:\nL\nS\nr   E   L [14.52]\nnucl nucl nucl nucl\nn\n0\nNOTE 14.5.– Some authors calculate the nucleation rate using the Volmer curve\nas the energy curve of an elementary step (see Figure 14.2.b) with the activation\nenergy of the ordinate maximum. This approach is incorrect, as we cannot accept\nthat a process that involves a large number of chemical bonds can be considered\nelementary.\nIn the previous calculation, we assumed the existence of a rate-determining step.\nConsidering the close proximity of each step, it is difficult to believe that one of the\nsteps will have a rate coefficient well below those of all the others. Hence the\npseudo-steady state mode is often accepted as a mode in which all stages of the\nagglomeration are rate-determining. The rate of such a mode can be calculated using\nthe law of slowness using the same space function for all steps because these steps\nhave the same multiplying coefficient given by [14.43] and belong to the same linear\nsequence.\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 383\nWith this model, the steps of the first stage of the promoter formation are always\nin equilibrium; their rate coefficients are taken to be infinitely larger than those of\nthe stages of agglomeration. Using [14.51], we can therefore write:\n1 n* 1\n\n\nn*\ni2\ni\n[14.53]\n  B h exp   E    n*  exp    X,i (G)   \n 1  RT   RT \nn*akT 1    i2  \n S\nA laborious calculation that is not reproduced here leads to:\n n*  8 n  *  a( B R N T 3 a ) / 5 2 / 2 h .   l 3 s n / ( 2 S V ) m 2 .    1 S 1   f h  e 1 t /2exp      1 3 6 (  R N T a )3  3 s  V ln m 2 S f  h 2 et     exp      R E T    \n[14.54]\nHence, with the pseudo-steady state mode, the surface rate is a complex\nexpression as a function of intensive variables. In this expression, we see the term of\nthe distance from actual conditions to the equilibrium emerging as in [14.32]. The\ntemperature appears in both the activation exponential and the standard Gibbs free\nenergy of the reaction in oversaturation (see expression [14.31]). The partial\npressures of reactant gases or reaction products appear as one power law in the\nexpression of oversaturation (see expression [14.31]). The control experiments are\ndone keeping S as a variable. We notice that the variable gas pressures and\ntemperatures are not separated.\nWith the pseudo-steady state mode, when experiments are performed at constant\ntemperatures and partial pressures of various gases, the areal rate of nucleation is\nindependent of time and only the variations in surface area S (see relation [14.52])\nL\nwill vary with time due to nucleation, and also growth.\nMore complex models for non-pseudo-steady state modes have been proposed,\nbut there are no experimental means specific enough to determine the nucleation rate\nthat would decide between such complex expressions.\n14.5.5. Surface and nucleation frequencies\nSince the amounts of materials involved with nucleation are often very low, we\nprefer to use the nucleation frequency instead of the rate, which is the number of\n384 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\ngrowing spots created per time unit as well as the surface nucleation frequency . If\nn is the amount of reference material and n* the dimension of the stable growth spot\n0\n(in numbers of elementary units), we have:\n \n B r nucl .n 0 .N a\n\n B  nucl .S L N a [14.55]\nn* n*\nand the surface frequency of nucleation becomes:\n  N\n   B a nucl [14.56]\nS\nL\nn*\nThus, the specific frequency has the same variables as the surface rate of\nnucleation, which are the temperature and partial pressure via oversaturation. The\npseudo-steady state modes leads to surface frequencies of nucleation independent of\ntime with isothermal and isobaric conditions.\n14.6. Physico-chemical growth models\nAs part of the separable rate and therefore the application of relation [14.3],\nphysico-chemical modeling can be applied to growth. As with homogeneous\nkinetics, it is the establishment of a mechanism that defines the reaction steps and\nareas where they occur. Intermediate compounds are formed and consumed during\nthese intermediate steps. Since Wagner’s work on the oxidation of metals by\ngaseous oxygen, it has been assumed that these heterogeneous kinetic intermediates\nare usually both adsorbed species and point defects in the solid phases, so the basic\nsteps are those of adsorption, desorption, chemical reactions near interfaces and\ndiffusion in solids. From this, we calculate the areal rate of growth versus partial\npressures and temperature. Since we have separated the morphological models, we\ncan consider plane interfaces of constant area units for physico-chemical models.\nThis defines equation of the reactivity as a function of the partial pressure of gases,\nconcentrations in the solid phases with several components and the temperature. We\nhave seen the example of the magnesium oxidation reaction involving oxygen\nvacancies in Chapter 8, section 8.1.5.2.\nWe will now examine the case of the growth mechanism of uranium reduction\nreaction by hydrogen [14.R7], which involves interstitial oxygen as a point defect.\nThe physico-chemical modeling of  does not depend on the morphological model\nas long as both approaches are addressed with the same direction of development of\nthe formed solid and the same location of the determining step:\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 385\nH +U O =4UO +H O [14.R7]\n2 4 9 2 2\nFigure 14.12 gives the location of the various phases during growth.\nHO + H\n2 2\nUO\n2\nUO\n4 9\nFigure 14.12. Relative positions of the phases during the\nreduction of UO by hydrogen\n4 9\nThe reaction takes place in five steps. Three of these steps [14.R7a], [14.R7b]\nand [14.R7c] occur at the external interface (between hydrogen and uranium\ndioxide). The fourth step is diffusion [14.R4d] and the last and fifth step is [14.R7e].\nThe first step is the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on a surface site of the\ndioxide formed:\nH +2s2H-s [14.R7a]\n2\nThe second step is the use of interstitial oxygen coming from the internal\ninterface (see steps [14.R7d] and [14.R7e]) to form hydroxides:\nH-s+O OH-s+V [14.R7b]\ni i\nThe third step is desorption of water:\nOH-s+H-sH O+2s [14.R7c]\n2\nThe fourth step is the diffusion of interstitial oxygen ion from the internal\ninterface to the external interface (step [14.R4d]):\nO (int) →O (ext) [14.R7d]\ni i\n386 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe last step involves the oxygen ion passing from the oxide network to the\ndioxide, which leaves an oxygen vacancy, destabilizes the network and causes the\nphase change:\nU O +(V) O +4UO [14.R7e]\n4 9 i UO2 i 2\nThe dioxide network is built at the internal interface with inside development.\nWith this model, as we done in section 8.1.5, we could deduct five of pseudo-\nsteady state solutions with a single rate-determining step.\n14.7. Conclusion on heterogeneous reactions\nThe kinetics of heterogeneous reactions are much more complex to interpret than\nhomogeneous reactions. We notice, however, that within the scope of pseudo-\nsteadiness, the validity of the relation of E (relation [14.3]) is fundamental. It has\nallowed us to decouple the modeling and to understand a mechanism considering\nfour models:\n– the morphological model of growth, which allows us to express the growth\nspace function E(t\n– the physico-chemical model of growth, which allows us to establish the growth\nreactivity function (P ,T) and is dealt with in the same way as a homogeneous\nG\nreaction mechanism;\n– the morphological model of nucleation, which allows us to determine function\nS (and\nL\n– the physico-chemical model of nucleation, which allows us to express function\n(P T) and is also dealt with using homogeneous reaction kinetics methods and\nG\nconsidering the thermodynamic influences of the surfaces.\nNote that these four models are not completely independent and one hypothesis\nmust be shared between them. For example, both growth models must recognize the\nsame rate-determining steps and the same direction of layer development.\nFinally, the application of the same relation [14.3] limits us to growth modeling\nconsidering pseudo-steady state modes and a single rate-determining step.\nHeterogeneous Stoichiometric Reactions 387\n14.8. Important figures in reaction kinetics\nCarl Wagner in association with Schottky proposed the point defect-mediated\nmechanism of mass transport in solids, which Wagner extended to the analysis of\nelectronic defects. For these works and Wagner’s subsequent research on local\nequilibrium, his oxidation rate theory and the concept of counter diffusion of\ncations, he is considered by some to be the “father of solid state chemistry”.\nThe German chemist Max Volmer made important contributions in\nelectrochemistry, particularly in electrode kinetics. He co-developed the Butler-\nVolmer equation, which formed the basis of phenomenological kinetic\nelectrochemistry, and discovered the migration of adsorbed molecules, known as\nVolmer diffusion.\nProf. Carl Wagner Prof. Max Volmer\n(1901-1976) (1885-1965)\nFigure 14.13. Important chemists\n\nChapter 15\nKinetics of Non-pseudo-steady State Modes\nSo far we have concentrated on the study of reactions occurring in a pseudo-\nsteady state mode. Obviously, such a state mode cannot exist throughout the entire\nreaction. At the beginning of the reaction, the amount of intermediate species\nstarting from zero value must increase. Similarly, at the end of the reaction, for these\nquantities to become zero they must decrease. During both periods the state is not\npseudo-steady as the reaction takes place in the transitory state.\nFor many reactions, these two periods are short enough, with only very small\nvariations in the extent of the reaction, to be neglected.\nIn some cases, however, these transitory periods cannot be neglected and a\nkinetic law that does not correspond to the one deduced with the pseudo-steady state\nis observed for a significant reaction extent, even if the state tends toward a pseudo-\nsteady state. We will study the example of the paralinear law, which is sometimes\nobtained during the oxidation of metal plates.\nFinally, other reactions are such that they can never reach the pseudo-steady state\nmode. This is true of those that lead to explosions or ignition. We will see the two\nclasses of systems that can be attributed to these reactions: thermal explosions and\nbranched chain reactions with a positive branching factor.\n15.1. Partial pseudo-steady state modes\nA partial pseudo-steady state mode is a state in which certain intermediates are\nnot pseudo-steady while others are. Such state modes may be treated as several\n390 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nsuccessive reactions, each following a pseudo-steady state mode and characterized\nby its own extent and rate.\nTo illustrate such a state, we will consider reaction [15.R1] in the gas phase and\nat constant volume, for which the mechanism is given by steps [15.R1a] to [15.R1d]\nwith the rate coefficients k , k , k and k , respectively. The intermediate M is more\n1 2 3 4\nstable than others and it is assumed the state mode is pseudo-steady for\nintermediates X and X but not for M:\n1 2\nA + 3B = C [15.R1]\nA → X1 [15.R1a]\nX\n1\n+ B → M [15.R1b]\nM + B → X [15.R1c]\n2\nX + B → C [15.R1d]\n2\nWe write the pseudo-steadiness for X and X :\n1 2\ndX \n1  k Ak X B0 [15.1]\n1 2 1\ndt\ndX \n2  k MBk X B0 [15.2]\n3 4 2\ndt\nWe deduce the intermediate concentrations:\nk A\n1\nX   [15.3]\n1\nk B\n2\nk M\nX   3 [15.4]\n2\nk X \n4 2\nWe now write the result for the non-pseudo-steady intermediate M:\ndM\n k X Bk MB0 [15.5]\n2 2 3\ndt\nKinetics of Non-pseudo-steady State Modes 391\nThe solution to equation [15.5] with the initial condition M0 at the start is:\nk A\nM 1 1expk Bt [15.6]\n3\nk\n3\nIt is then possible to calculate every concentration as a function of time.\nWe can also consider that we are dealing with two successive reactions [15.R2]\nand [15.R3], both of which are pseudo-steady. The first reaction produces M and the\nsecond produces C from M:\nA + B = M [15.R2]\nM + 2B = C [15.R3]\nThe first reaction has two steps with an intermediate X and a rate v . The second\n1 1\nreaction has also two steps, an intermediate X and a rate v .\n2 2\nWe have:\ndM\n v v [15.7]\n1 2\ndt\nand can calculate:\nv k A [15.8]\n1 1\nv k MB [15.9]\n2 3\nThe concentrations of the reactants and products follow:\ndA\n v [15.10]\n1\ndt\ndB\n v 2v [15.11]\n1 2\ndt\ndC\n v [15.12]\n2\ndt\n392 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n15.2. The paralinear law of metal oxidation\nSome of the state modes involving two rate-determining steps (mixed) do not\ncompel pseudo-steadiness on all of the intermediate species. This is especially the\ncase with mixed state modes that are not pseudo-steady on an intermediate. We will\nexamine this case in order to develop the method and show that the pseudo-steady\nstate mode appears to be the limit when time tends to infinity. Our goal is not to\nestablish general relations but to explain the procedure to be adopted.\nFor our example, we will consider reaction [15.R4] with a simple linear reaction\nscheme involving four steps and three intermediates, which is described by the\nmechanisms in steps [15.R4a] to [15.R4d]:\nABC [15.R4]\nA X [15.R4a]\n1\nX B X [15.R4b]\n1 2\nX  X [15.R4c]\n2 3\nX C [15.R4d]\n3\nWe assume that we have mixed kinetics between steps [15.R4b] and [15.R4c]\nthat have set rate constants; the other steps with infinite rate constants are constantly\nat equilibrium. The reaction is performed at constant concentrations. The\nequilibrium of the step preceding [15.R4b], which is [15.R3a], allows us to\ncalculate:\nX   K A [15.13]\n1 1\nWith equilibrium, step [15.R1d] that follows [15.R4c] allows us to calculate:\nC\nX   [15.14]\n3\nK\n4\nThe rate in relation to A is set by the steps consuming the main reactant A, in this\ncase step [15.R4a]:\nr  E [15.15]\nA 1 1\nKinetics of Non-pseudo-steady State Modes 393\nWe now assume that any amount of materials is pseudo-steady, with the\nexception of X ; then follows:\n2\n E   E [15.16]\n1 1 2 2\nand:\n E   E [15.17]\n3 3 4 4\nThe rate can therefore be written:\nr  E [15.18]\nA 2 2\nThe amount of X is:\n2\ndX \n2  n  E   E  [15.19]\n0 2 2 3 3\ndt\nIf V denotes the volume of the area or a portion of the area including\n2\nintermediate X , we have:\n2\nX   X V [15.20]\n2 2 2\nand assuming that the intermediate concentrations are very low:\ndX  dX  dV dX \n2 V 2 X  2 V 2 [15.21]\n2 2 2\ndt dt dt dt\nIf, including the reactivities, we have:\ndX   k\" \nV 2 2   k 2 ' K 1 ABk\" 2 X 2   E 2 k' 3 X 2  3  E 3\ndt  K 4 \n[15.22]\nsolving this differential equation allows us to determine the concentration of\nintermediate [X ] as a function of time; which can therefore be included in rate\n2\nexpression [15.6]:\nr   k ' K AB  k \"X   E [15.23]\nA 2 1 2 2 2\n394 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe notice that with the generic case, the rate is not separable since concentration\n[X ] includes terms E and E according to [15.10].\n2 2 3\nV\nFor example, if we consider the specific case where E  E  2, which is\n2 3\nn\n0\nalso the case of an homogeneous reaction, relation [15.10] becomes:\nV 2 dX 2    k 2 ' K 1 ABk\" 2 X 2  V 2   k' 3 X 2  k\" 3   V 2\ndt n 0  K 4  n 0\n[15.24]\nTo simplify the writing of these expressions, we denote the following:\nk\"\nk' K AB 3\nk' k\"  2 1 K\nM  3 2 and N  4 [15.25]\nn n\n0 0\nWe can write [15.24] (where M and N are independent of time) as:\ndX \n2  MX   N [15.26]\n2\ndt\nwhich, after integration, gives:\nN\nX X  exp(Mt) (1expMt) [15.27]\n2 2 0 M\nHence by using [15.23], the rate has the following forms:\nr A     k 2 ' K 1 AB k\" 2    X 2  0 exp Mt M N (1expMt)       V n 0 2\n[15.28]\nHence the reactivity depends on time but the rate is still separable, even though\nthe two terms may depend on the time, since every reaction step has the same space\nfunction.\nKinetics of Non-pseudo-steady State Modes 395\nIf time tends toward infinity, we go toward the pseudo-steady state mode:\nN\nX   and the rate tends toward:\ni st M\nr A   k 2 ' K 1 AB  k \" 2 N   V 2 [15.29]\n M n\n0\nAt this limit, concentration X tends toward steadiness and the reactivity becomes\n2\nindependent from time. Only the space function term may depend on the time.\nFigure 15.1. “Paralinear” curve during metal oxidation\nFigure 15.1 gives the appearance the extent of the reaction (with respect to\nreactant A). The curve is concave (called a “parabolic” curve, which is not formally\ncorrect) and tends toward the oblique asymptote given by [15.28] if the volume is\nindependent of time. This law is sometimes encountered with the oxidation of metal\nfoils, which is governed by the paralinear law for state mode, whose rate is\ndetermined by two interfacial phases.\n15.3. Thermal runaway and ignition of reactions\nWhen a highly exothermic reaction occurs rapidly at a given temperature, the\nheat released cannot be removed by conduction or convection to the outside. This\nresults in a rise in temperature, which in turn causes a sharp acceleration of the\nreaction with more heat production. The rate may become increasingly large and\nthen explosive. This is the theory of explosion by heat accumulation described by\nvan ’t Hoff. The explosion threshold is reached when the heat flow supplied by the\nreaction, given by the product of rate by enthalpy, is no longer compensated for by\nthe heat flow discharged from the reaction medium by conduction or convection.\n396 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWhen considering the combustion of hydrogen or some hydrocarbons, however,\nif we plot a curve of the limit of inflammation of the mixture in a pressure–\ntemperature space, we obtain curve DCBA as shown in Figure 15.2. This curve\ndivides the plane into two regions: one on the right in which any mixture ignites\nspontaneously; and a second region to the left of the curve in which the oxidation\nreaction occurs without inflammation.\nFigure 15.2. Thresholds of spontaneous ignition\nIf we consider a certain temperature between point B and point C and the\npressure is increased, after the “slow” combustion area we will reach a first pressure\nthreshold P . This is also called the lower ignition pressure; at pressures above this\n1\nthe mixture ignites. By further increasing the pressure we will reach the\ncorresponding pressure threshold P , above which there is no mixture ignition. By\n2\nfurther increasing the pressure, we now reach threshold pressure P , from which\n3\nignition of the mixture reappears.\nThe above theory of explosion by accumulation does not explain this\nphenomenon. At most, we can assign the upper threshold, P (DCA curve), because\n3\nthis theory predicts only one lower level of flammability. The existence of branched\nchain reactions allows us to explain the existence of the first two critical pressures\nP and P .\n1 2\nOther factors intervene to modify the values of critical pressures, such as the\npresence of inert gas which lowers the pressure at both lower and upper threshold\npressures of ignition. The lower area of inflammation may eventually disappear.\nSome substances play a positive catalytic role, for example nitrogen pentoxide for\noxidation. Others have a negative role, acting as an inhibitor, for example halogens\nin oxidation reactions.\nKinetics of Non-pseudo-steady State Modes 397\n15.4. Chemical ignition of gaseous mixtures\nThe inflammation of hydrocarbons is generally explained by the existence of\nbranched chain reactions, and we will now see how the modeling of these reactions\ncontributes to an understanding of the ignition process.\n15.4.1. Branched chains with linear branching and chain breaking in the bulk\nLooking back at branched chain reactions with linear initiation and breaking in\nthe bulk, we obtain equation [12.63], recalled here:\ndX\nv X [15.30]\ni\ndt\nIn section 12.6.3 we saw that when the branching factor  is negative, the\nsolution tends toward a pseudo-steady state. We now consider the case where the\nbranching factor is positive: 0.\nIt is easy to calculate that in this case if [X] = 0 for t = 0, the solution to equation\n[15.30] is:\nv v\nX iexpt1 i expt [15.31]\n \nWe notice that there is no limit to the concentration of the active center for\ninfinities.

Systems without pseudo-steady states\nTherefore by following the sign of the branching factor, the reaction may or may\nnot reach a pseudo-steady state.\n15.4.2.

Justification of the two lower ignition thresholds\nRelation [15.45] defines the transition from one state mode with limited chain\nlengths to a state with unlimited length chains, which is a state mode without\npseudo-steadiness, i.e. eventually an explosive state.\nIt is said that there is a pseudo-steady state mode only if:\n 1 f  f \nd 2 m ra r  2 [15.47]\nD\nWe know that according to the kinetic theory of gases, the interdiffusion\ncoefficient is proportional to the mean free path , at a mean rate of molecules c and\ninversely proportional to the pressure P. Therefore taking into account [12.24],\n[12.25], [12.26], [12.35] and [15.46], the pseudo-steady state mode only exists if:\n3P 2 d 2\n2\n [15.48]\n2\n q\n0\nhence a limit pressure is:\n2 2\nP 2   0 q [15.49]\n3d 2\nIt is reasonable to assume that the probability of the chain breaking, varies in\nthe gas phase in proportion with the pressure. Indeed, the propagation of chain\nreactions with or without branching are due to bimolecular collisions; whereas\nbreaking reactions are due to trimolecular collisions. As the number of double\ncollisions varies proportionally to the squared value of the pressure and the number\nof triple collisions to the cubic value of the pressure, the probability of termination\nmust ultimately vary as the ratio of the cube over the square of the pressure, which is\nin proportion to the pressure:\nbP [15.50]\n402 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe condition for the existence of a pseudo-steady state mode therefore\nbecomes:\n2 2\n q\nbP 0 0 [15.51]\n2 2\n3d P\nLet us have a look at the following equation:\n2 2\n q\nbP 0 0 [15.52]\n2 2\n3d P\nThe equation has two positive roots P and P and condition [15.40] is satisfied\n1 2\noutside these roots. Thus we recover the existence of an explosive state mode\nbetween two pressures P and P at a given temperature, as shown in Figure 15.2.\n1 2\nWe would obtain similar results (to the nearest numerical coefficient) with other\nforms of reactors.\nThe presence of an inert gas will reduce the diffusion of active centers toward\nthe walls and lower thresholds P and P .\n1 2\nThe composition of the gas phase will also have an influence on the threshold\nvalues with the frequency of collisions between reactants.\nThus the theory of branched chain reactions can account for two explosive\nthresholds restricting an area of lower ignition. Qualitative results are therefore\ninterpreted correctly.\nThe third pressure threshold (P , see Figure 15.2) is probably attributed to the\n3\nthermal acceleration, as seen in section 15.3.\n15.4.2.3. Calculating the rate as a function of time\nTo determine the rate versus time, the mean concentration must be calculated\nand then [12.18] applied.

This factor is calculated as\ndiscussed in section 12.6.4 with respect to the “chemical” terms to which we add the\ndiffusion term that keeps the same form as in equation [15.47] in D/d2; only the\nnumerical coefficient depends on the shape of the reactor.\nIn conclusion we see that if we take into account the consumption of reagents,\nthe concept of a chain reaction allows us to account for all the curves in Figure 12.1,\nparticularly the shapes of curves 1 and 2 of this figure, which reactions with limited\nsequences could not predict. We have also reported an effect of the shape and\ndimensions of the reactors. Finally, we have accounted for the three explosion\nthreshold pressure limits at constant temperature.\n\nAPPENDICES\n\nAppendix 1\nPoint Defects and Structure\nElements of Solids\nIn reactions involving crystallized solids, the intermediates are frequently\nstructure elements among which the point defects play a major role. A branch of\nchemistry, called “quasi-chemistry” has thus been developed by taking into account\nthese defects in quasi-chemical reactions that feature thermodynamic and kinetic\nproperties. It is often such reactions that constitute the elementary steps of\nheterogeneous reactions.\nA1.1. Point defects of solids\nIn a crystalline solid the point lattices are normally occupied by atoms,\nmolecules or ions called components. The lattice thus formed is called the perfect\nlattice. In practice, this lattice can display irregularities that are called defects.\nA point defect is an irregularity at the level of a point lattice and the following\ncan be encountered:\n– the vacancy: this is the absence of a point lattice of the species that is normally\npresent in the perfect lattice;\n– the interstitial: this is the presence of an element of the affected solid (atom,\nmolecule or ion) in a position between point lattices;\n– the exchange defect: this is the replacement of the normal element of a point\nlattice by another element of the solid;\n408 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n– inclusion of a foreign element: this is a foreign element that has been\nhammered into an interstitial position in the solid;\n– substitution of a foreign element: this is a foreign element that has replaced a\nnormal element in the solid at a lattice point.\nA1.2. Definition of a structural element\nA structural element is an atom, ion or vacancy (empty space) at a specific site of\nthe crystal. The notion of structural element combines the notions of a chemical\nspecies and its surroundings through the nature of the lattice site being considered. A\nstructural element can be:\n– an atom of the solid in a normal lattice site (in the sense of an ideal solid);\n– an atom of the solid in an abnormal lattice site (substitution of an atom of a\ndifferent nature and atom in an interstitial position, etc.);\n– a vacancy in the normal lattice (empty space in the ideal solid);\n– an empty interstitial position that can be regarded as a vacancy in an interstitial\nposition;\n– an atom that is foreign to the solid in a specific lattice site (for example,\nchromium replacing zinc in zinc oxide).\nWe can thus completely describe the solid from the enumeration of its structure\nelements by assimilating free electrons and electron holes that might be present in\norder to be complete.\nStructure elements can carry variable charges. The effective charge of a\nstructural element, qe, is the difference between its actual charge (qr) and the charge\nthat the structural element occupying the same site in the ideal crystal would have\n(the normal charge, qn ):\nq  q  q\ne r n\nAn element is said to be non-ionized if its effective charge is zero.\nThe normal structure elements of the solid − which means they are present in the\nideal solid (atom or ion of the solid in a normal lattice site or an empty interstitial\nposition) − have a zero effective charge.\nAppendix 1 409\nA1.3. Symbolic representation of structure elements\nSimilarly to the emergence of the need for symbolic writing of atoms and\nmolecules in chemistry, it became necessary to create a symbolic system for\nstructure elements. This notation system should provide three types of information\nabout an element:\n– the atom or chemical element concerned;\n– the lattice site occupied (in reference to the ideal solid);\n– the effective (or actual) charge. We usually choose the effective charge\nbecause it is null for all normal elements.\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has advocated\nthe use of Kröger’s notation. Tables A1.1, A1.2, A1.3, A1.4 and A1.5 show all of\nthe notations for the various types of structure elements, applied to the example of\nalumina. This is a “dummy” example, given as it gathers together all of the cases\nthat will be met.\nThe symbol ' which figures in the top right-hand side of the element signifies an -\n1 effective charge. The symbol ° represents the +1 effective charge and the zero\neffective charge is represented by X (a cross). The presence of this sign is not\nmandatory, so it can be omitted. Index i is assigned to an element in an interstitial\nposition.\nAl3+ ion in normal position (q = 0) ....................................

To prevent any confusion with the\nvanadium notation, which has the same symbol, the International Union of Pure and\nApplied Chemistry suggests changing the symbol of vanadium and using Va when\ndealing with structure elements.\n410 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nAl3+ ion in interstitial position (q = +3) ..........................

Symbols of structure elements substituted by foreign elements\nAssociations of structure elements are represented by writing them without their\neffective charge between brackets, and adding the group effective charge after the\nbracket. For example, the association of the aluminum ion vacancy with an oxygen\nion vacancy is denoted: (V V )'. We notice that we will obtain the same entity and\nAl O\ntherefore the same notation of effective charge (-1) if each of these vacancies had\ntrapped an electron and an electron hole, respectively.\nWith these notations we will be able to write reactions that involve structure\nelements.\nAppendix 1 411\nA1.4. Reactions involving structure elements in quasi-chemical reactions\nSince chemical reactions involve atoms and molecules, ionic reactions and\nelectrochemical involve ions, reactions that are called quasi-chemical reactions\ninvolve structure elements.\nFor instance, by using Kröger’s notation the consumption reaction of oxygen\nvacancies in magnesium oxide by oxygen gas is written as follows:\n1\nV  O  O\nO 2 O\n2\nThis shows that the oxygen atom derived from the gas fills the vacancy to place\nan oxygen atom in the normal position in the solid magnesium oxide.\nA1.5. Equilibria and reactivities of quasi-chemical reactions\nThe structure elements of a solid whose proportions vary according to different\nparameters are regarded as components of a solution. In other words, a solid can be\nviewed as a solid solution of its structure elements.\nThis property allows us to apply all the properties of the components of a\nsolution to structure elements. The mass action law of chemical equilibria especially\napplies to quasi-chemical equilibria using concentrations of structure elements.\nFor the previous reaction of the oxygen vacancy with the gas, the mass action\nlaw for diluted defects will be written as follows at equilibrium:\nK  VP 1/2\n O  O\n2\nThe concentration of [OO] in very high in the magnesium oxide and so is\nregarded to be constant, such as water molecules for ionic reactions in aqueous\nsolution. This oxygen belongs to the solvent as well as the magnesium ions in\nnormal cationic positions and the empty interstitial positions.\nSimilarly, the reactivities of elementary quasi-chemical reactions will be written\nas a function of the concentrations of the structure elements, through the rate\ncoefficients. So, if the previous reaction was elementary (which is unlikely because\nit involves a fraction of atom), its reactivity would be:\n412 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\n \nφV P 1/2\nO\nUltimately, the point defects are reaction intermediates at the solid state in the\nsame way as the radicals and ions in liquid and gas phases.\nAppendix 2\nNotions of Microscopic Thermodynamics\nThe aim of this appendix is to gather together a few statistical thermodynamics\nnotions and, in particular, to establish the expression of equilibrium constants using\npartition functions, which is useful in the activated complex theory.\nA2.1. Molecule distribution between the different energy states\nHere consider a group of N molecules that are chemically identical. Among the\nmolecules, N has an energy of  , N an energy of  […] and N an energy of . The\n1 1 2 2 i i\nnumber of possibilities W (number of complexions) by which to distribute N\nmolecules in the way thus described is:\nN!\nW  [A2.1]\nN !N !N !...N !\n1 2 3 k\nUsing the logarithm of the previous expression, we have:\nk\nlnW lnN!lnN !

To do so, we multiply relations [A2.10] and [A2.12] by\nundefined constants  and respectively. The system of three equations becomes:\nk\nN 0 [A2.13]\ni\ni1\nk\nlnN δN 0 [A2.14]\ni i\ni1\nk\n δN 0 [A2.15]\ni i\ni1\nBy adding equations [A2.13], [A2.14] and [A2.15], we obtain:\nk\nln N  δN 0 [A2.16]\ni i i\ni1\nThe N variations being arbitrary, for condition [A2.16] to be met i must be:\ni\nln N  0 [A2.17]\ni i\nthus:\nN expexp  Aexp  [A2.18]\ni i i\n416 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nWe can calculate A by writing that N is the sum of every N, and obtain:\ni\nN\nA [A2.19]\nk\nexp \ni\ni1\nOn the other hand, we can demonstrate that 1/k T (where T is the absolute\nB\ntemperature and k is Boltzmann’s constant with k =R/N).\nB B a\nWe obtain the most probable distribution of molecules between the different\nenergy states by calculating:\n  \nexp i \n k B T\nN N [A2.20]\ni k   \nexp i\n\ni1  k B T\nA2.2. Partition functions\nThe exponential sum appearing in expression [A2.20] is found quite frequently\nin statistical thermodynamics. This sum is also called the partition function of\nsystem including N molecules:\nk   \nZ exp i  [A2.21]\ni1  k B T\nThe system’s full partition function includes terms related to the i different types\nof energies: nuclear, electronic, molecular vibrations, molecule rotations, as well as\ntranslation and interactions between the different types of molecules.\nTo simplify this, we agree that for a molecule these different types of energies\nare independent (this is not quite true, especially as the interdependence of the\nvibration and rotation energies of a molecule are known). We can therefore write the\noverall energy of a molecule like the sum of the different types of energy\ncontributions:\n      [A2.22]\nn e v r t I\nAppendix 2 417\nThe partition function becomes:\n        \nZ exp i n  exp i e  exp i v \n     \nk T k T k T\ni  B  i  B i  B \nn e v [A2.23]\n        \nexp i r  exp i t  exp i I \n \nk T k T k T\ni  B  i  B i  B \nr t I\nWe can show the partial partition functions related to the different types of\nenergies:\n  \nZ n exp   i n   ,\nk T\ni  B \nn\n  \nZ e exp   i e   , [A2.24]\nk T\ni  B \ne\n  \nZ v exp   i v  \nk T\ni  B \nv\n  \nZ\nr\nexp i r ,\nk T\ni  B \nr\n  \nZ t exp   i t   , [A2.25]\nk T\ni  B \nt\n  \nZ I exp i I \nk T\ni  B \nI\nThe overall partial partition function can therefore be written as the product of\nthe different types of partial partition functions:\nZ Z Z Z Z Z Z [A2.26]\nn e v r t I\nIn chemical reactors, the nucleus energy is not modified; the constant value of\nthis energy will therefore be used as the origin, and the nucleus partition function\n418 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nwill equal one unit. This is the same for the electronic energy of reactions that do not\ninvolve atoms in their excited state. Moreover, if we respect the rule of perfect\nsolutions, the interaction term will also be equal to one unit. Finally, with these\nassumptions the total partition function is written as the product of three terms:\nZ Z Z Z [A2.27]\nv r t\nWe now have to examine the three partial partition functions of vibration Z ,\nv\nrotation Z and translation Z.\nr t\nA2.3. Degrees of freedom of a molecule\nThe calculation of partial partition functions requires knowledge of the number\nof degrees of freedom for each type of movement in the molecule.\nIf a molecule is made of N atoms, it has a total of 3N degrees of freedom.\nUsually a molecule has three degrees of freedom of translation. A nonlinear\nmolecule has three degrees of freedom of rotation; whereas a linear molecule only\nhas two. The number of degrees of freedom of vibration is easily deduced:\n– linear molecules: 3N – 5 degrees of freedom of vibration;\n– nonlinear molecules: 3N – 6 degrees of freedom of vibration.\nFor example, a diatomic molecule (N = 2), which is obviously linear, will have\nsix degrees of freedom including three of translation, two of rotation and one of\nvibration.\nA2.4. Elementary partition functions\nA2.4.1. Vibration partition function\nFor each degree of freedom of vibration, there is a vibration frequency  (in s-1),\ni\nand the respective partition function is written:\n1\nz  [A2.28]\nv\ni  h \n1exp i \n k B T\nAppendix 2 419\nThis measure has two limit values that are often used (see section A2.4.4):\nk T\nIf h k T then z  B [A2.29]\ni B v\ni h\ni\nIf h k T then z 1 [A2.30]\ni B v\ni\nWhen the molecule has n degrees of freedom of vibration, the overall partition\nfunction is:\nn\nZ z [A2.31]\nv \ni\ni1\nA2.4.2. Rotation partition function\nFor a linear molecule with a moment of inertia I related to the axis perpendicular\nto the straight line linking atoms and passing by the center of mass, the partition\nfunction of rotation is:\n8 2Ik T\nz  B [A2.32]\nr h2\nIf every atom in the molecule is identical, coefficient  is equal to 2, otherwise\n = 1.\nWith nonlinear polyatomic molecules, if I , I and I are the moments of inertia\n1 2 3\nwithin three rectangular axes passing through the center of mass, the partition\nfunction of rotation is:\n3/2\nz \nI\n1\nI\n2\nI\n3 \n8 2 k\nB\nT\n [A2.33]\nr    h 2  \nwhere coefficient  is a number related to the symmetry of the molecule. If there is\nno symmetry,  = 1; for NH types of molecules,  = 3; for C H molecules,  = 3;\n3 2 4\nand for benzene types of molecules,  = 12.\n420 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nA2.4.3.

Equilibrium constant and partition functions\nWe now consider the chemical reaction:\n0 A\ni i\ni\nThe equilibrium constant for the concentrations will be:\nK C  i [A2.46]\nc i\ni\nor:\nlnK  lnC [A2.47]\nc i i\ni\nAppendix 2 423\nMoreover, using [A2.45], the associated variation of free energy F is:\nΔF  F U  k N TlnZ [A2.48]\ni i i 0 i B a i\ni\ni i i\nbut by the definition of , the internal energy is:\nU ΔU [A2.49]\ni 0 0\ni\ni\nMoreover, we know that the partition function Z includes a translation term\nproportional to the volume and thus we can write:\nZ Z V [A2.50]\ni 0\ni\nIf we also consider the molar measure (R =Nk ), and notice that C =1/V (V\na B m m\nmolar volume), the associated free energy is therefore:\nΔF ΔU  RTlnZ  RTlnC [A2.51]\n0 i 0 i i\ni\ni\nIf we consider a constant temperature, function F is the thermodynamic\npotential, therefore at equilibrium F = 0 and we obtain:\nΔU\n0  lnZ  lnC [A2.52]\ni 0 i i\nRT i\ni\nfrom which by comparing equation [A2.47], the equilibrium constant is:\nK c  Z 0  i exp   ΔU 0   [A2.53]\ni  RT \ni\nThe product is extended to all the constituents included in the equation’s\ndefinition. Hence the equilibrium constant in the perfect solution phase (gaseous,\nliquid or solid) is defined from the partition functions of the molecules entering into\nthe reaction (reactant and products) using relation [A2.53].\n\nAppendix 3\nVibration Frequency of the\nActivated Complex\nTo calculate the vibration frequency of the activated complex, we use the\nsurfaces of potential energies. The method used is based on the theory of small\nvibrations applied to the stationary points of a potential surface, which is either a\nmaximum or minimum of a system at equilibrium; whereas the coordinate variation\ndoes not affect the potential energy.\nThe generic expression of the energy potential U of a system of particles for\ndisplacements qk and qj of coordinates k and j is given by the approximation of\nTaylor’s development:\n2\nU 1  U\nU U  q   q q [A3.1]\n0 k k j\nq 2 q q\nk k k k j\nAt equilibrium, the maximum potential is:\nU\n0 [A3.2]\nq\nk\nand [A3.1] becomes:\n2\n1  U\nU U   q q [A3.3]\n0 k j\n2 q q\nk k j\n426 An Introduction to Chemical Kinetics\nThe origins can be changed so that the energy potential is zero.

Such studies also enable us to understand the mechanism\nbywhichthereactionoccurs. Thus,inchemicalkineticswecanalsodeterminetherate\nofchemicalreaction.\nFromthekineticstandpointthereactionsareclassifiedintotwogroups:\na)homogeneousreactionswhichoccurentirelyinonephaseb)heterogeneousreactions\nwhere the transformation takes place on the surface of a catalyst or the walls of a con-\ntainer.\n1.2 Rate of reaction\nThe rate of reaction i.e. the velocity of a reaction is the amount of a chemical change\noccurringperunittime.\nThe rate is generally expressed as the decrease in concentration of a reactant or as the\nincreaseinconcentrationoftheproduct. IfCtheconcentrationofareactantatanytime\ntis,therateis−dC oriftheconcentrationofaproductbexatanytimet,theratewould\ndt\nbedx.\ndt\nThe time is usually expressed in seconds. The rate will have units of concentration\ndividedbytime.\nTheconcentrationsaretakeningm-moles/litre,hencerateismoles/litre/second.\nFactorsinfluencingtherateofreaction\nRateofachemicalreactionisinfluencedbythefollowingfactors\n(i)Temperature(ii)Concentrationofthereactants(iii)Natureofreactants(iv)Catalysts\n(v)Radiation\n(i)Temperature\nInmostcases,therateofareactioninahomogeneousreactionisapproximatelydoubled\nortripledbyanincreaseintemperatureofonly100C.Insomecasestheriseinreaction\nratesareevenhigher.\n(ii)Concentrationofthereactants\nAtafixedtemperatureandintheabsenceofcatalyst,therateofgivenreactionincreases\nwithincreasedconcentrationofreactants. Withincreasingconcentrationofthereactant\n4\nthe number of molecules per unit volume is increased, thus the collision frequency is\nincreased,whichultimatelycausesincreasedreactionrate.\n(iii)Natureofreactants\nAchemicalreactioninvolvestherearrangementofatomsbetweenthereactingmolecules\ntotheproduct. Oldbondsarebrokenandnewbondsareformed. Consequently,thena-\nture and the strength of the bonds in reactant molecules greatly influence the rate of its\ntransformation into products. The reaction in which involve lesser bond rearrangement\nproceedsmuchfasterthanthosewhichinvolvelargerbondrearrangement.\n(iv)Catalysts\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is increased in presence of a catalyst which ultimately\nenhancedthespeedofachemicalreaction.\n(v)Radiation\nThe rate of a number of chemical reactions increases when radiations of specific wave\nlengthareabsorbedbythereactingmolecules. Suchreactionsarecalledphotochemical\nreactions.\nFor example, chlorine may be mixed safely with hydrogen in dark, since the reaction\nbetweenthetwoisveryslow.

Thus,\nif the rate of a reaction depends on the first power of the concentration of reactant, i.e.\nRate = KC1\nThus the reaction is said to be of the first order. When the rate is proportional to the\nproduct of two reactant concentrations or the square of the concentration of a reactant,\nthereactionisofthesecondorder.\nForexample,thedecompositionofhydroiodicacid\nRate = KC2\nHI\nRate = KC2\nHI\nandthehydrogen-iodinereaction\nH +I −→2HI\n2 2\nRate=KC C\nH2 I2\nHerebotharesecondorderreactions.\nIfthereactionrateisexperimentallyfoundtoberepresentedby\ndC\n− =KCn\ndt\nTheorderofthereactionisn.\nIf several reactants A, B, C, .......etc are involved and it is observed experimentally\nthattherateoftheprocessisgivenby,\ndc\n− =KCαC β C γ.......\ndt A B C\nThentheorderofthereactionwouldben=α+β+γ+.......\nThereactionissaidtobeαthorderwithrespecttoA,βthorderwithrespecttoBetc.\nBut there are reactions in which the order is fractional i.e. n= 1,3etc..
